**Run with:**
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

**Visual Elements:**
- Tech-themed dark background with cyan/green particle effects
- Floating code symbols (`{ } < /> import class def`)
- Smooth hover animations on all interactive elements
- Professional gradient text effects

## 2. Cosmic Space RAG App (`cosmic_space_rag_app.py`)

**Features:**
- 🌌 Multi-layered nebula background with realistic space colors
- ⭐ Enhanced starfield with twinkling and drifting animations
- 💫 Shooting star animations crossing the screen
- 🪐 Animated parallax planet with rotating surface details
- ✨ Floating cosmic debris with physics-based movement
- 🔮 Advanced glassmorphism cards with 3D hover effects

**Run with:**
```bash
streamlit run cosmic_space_rag_app.py
```

**Visual Elements:**
- Deep space background with purple/blue/pink nebula colors
- Multiple shooting star trails at different speeds
- Rotating planet with crater details in bottom right
- Floating cosmic particles throughout the screen
- 3D card transformations on hover

## 3. Simple Space RAG App (`simple_space_rag_app.py`)

**Features:**
- 🌟 Elegant gradient background with subtle particle effects
- 📱 Clean, modern design with animated components
- ✨ Shimmer effects on metric containers
- 🎨 Beautiful typography with Space Grotesk font
- 💫 Smooth hover transitions throughout

**Run with:**
```bash
streamlit run simple_space_rag_app.py
```

**Visual Elements:**
- Softer color palette with blue/purple/orange accents
- Floating star particles with gentle animations
- Gradient text effects with border glow
- Enhanced cards with backdrop blur effects

## Performance Notes

- All animations use CSS for optimal performance
- GPU-accelerated transforms where possible
- Optimized background layers to prevent performance issues
- Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes

## Database Requirements

The space apps require `space_articles_database.json` (✅ Present - 1,100 articles loaded)

## Technical Implementation

### Animation Techniques:
- **CSS Keyframes**: Smooth, performant animations
- **Transform3D**: Hardware acceleration for complex movements
- **Backdrop-filter**: Modern blur effects
- **Gradient Animations**: Dynamic color shifts
- **Particle Systems**: CSS-based floating elements

### Interactive Elements:
- **Hover Effects**: 3D transforms and glow effects
- **Button Animations**: Shimmer and scale transitions  
- **Card Interactions**: Lift and rotate effects
- **Input Focus**: Glow and lift animations

### Background Layers:
1. **Base Gradient**: Primary color scheme
2. **Nebula Layer**: Animated color clouds (space apps)
3. **Particle Layer**: Floating stars/particles
4. **Interactive Layer**: Shooting stars, debris
5. **UI Layer**: Glassmorphism components

## Browser Compatibility

- ✅ Chrome/Edge (full support)
- ✅ Firefox (full support) 
- ✅ Safari (full support with minor fallbacks)

## Launch Commands

```bash
# Repository Analyzer with Tech Animations
streamlit run app.py --server.port 8501

# Cosmic Space Explorer with Nebula Effects  
streamlit run cosmic_space_rag_app.py --server.port 8502
