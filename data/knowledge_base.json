      "title": "Neutron star",
      "content": "A neutron star is the gravitationally collapsed core of a massive supergiant star. It results from the supernova explosion of a massive star—combined with gravitational collapse—that compresses the core past white dwarf star density to that of atomic nuclei. Surpassed only by black holes, neutron stars are the second smallest and densest known class of stellar objects. Neutron stars have a radius on the order of 10 kilometers (6 miles) and a mass of about 1.4 solar masses (M☉). Stars that collapse into neutron stars have a total mass of between 10 and 25 M☉ or possibly more for those that are especially rich in elements heavier than hydrogen and helium.\nOnce formed, neutron stars no longer actively generate heat and cool over time, but they may still evolve further through collisions or accretion. Most of the basic models for these objects imply that they are composed almost entirely of neutrons, as the extreme pressure causes the electrons and protons present in normal matter to combine into additional neutrons. These stars are partially supported against further collapse by neutron degeneracy pressure, just as white dwarfs are supported against collapse by electron degeneracy pressure. However, this is not by itself sufficient to hold up an object beyond 0.7 M☉ and repulsive nuclear forces increasingly contribute to supporting more massive neutron stars. If the remnant star has a mass exceeding the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit, approximately 2.2 to 2.9 M☉, the combination of degeneracy pressure and nuclear forces is insufficient to support the neutron star, causing it to collapse and form a black hole. The most massive neutron star detected so far, PSR J0952–0607, is estimated to be 2.35±0.17 M☉.\nNewly formed neutron stars may have surface temperatures of ten million K or more. However, since neutron stars generate no new heat through fusion, they inexorably cool down after their formation. Consequently, a given neutron star reaches a surface temperature of one million K when it is between one thousand and one million years old. Older and even-cooler neutron stars are still easy to discover. For example, the well-studied neutron star, RX J1856.5−3754, has an average surface temperature of about 434,000 K. For comparison, the Sun has an effective surface temperature of 5,780 K.\nNeutron star material is remarkably dense: a normal-sized matchbox containing neutron-star material would have a weight of approximately 3 billion tonnes, the same weight as a 0.5-cubic-kilometer chunk of the Earth (a cube with edges of about 800 meters) from Earth's surface.\nAs a star's core collapses, its rotation rate increases due to conservation of angular momentum, so newly formed neutron stars typically rotate at up to several hundred times per second. Some neutron stars emit beams of electromagnetic radiation that make them detectable as pulsars, and the discovery of pulsars by Jocelyn Bell Burnell and Antony Hewish in 1967 was the first observational suggestion that neutron stars exist. The fastest-spinning neutron star known is PSR J1748−2446ad, rotating at a rate of 716 times per second or 43,000 revolutions per minute, giving a linear (tangential) speed at the surface on the order of 0.24c (i.e., nearly a quarter the speed of light).\nThere are thought to be around one billion neutron stars in the Milky Way, and at a minimum several hundred million, a figure obtained by estimating the number of stars that have undergone supernova explosions. However, many of them have existed for a long period of time and have cooled down considerably. These stars radiate very little electromagnetic radiation; most neutron stars that have been detected occur only in certain situations in which they do radiate, such as if they are a pulsar or a part of a binary system. Slow-rotating and non-accreting neutron stars are difficult to detect, due to the absence of electromagnetic radiation; however, since the Hubble Space Telescope's detection of RX J1856.5−3754 in the 1990s, a few nearby neutron stars that appear to emit only thermal radiation have been detected.\nNeutron stars in binary systems can undergo accretion, in which case they emit large amounts of X-rays. During this process, matter is deposited on the surface of the stars, forming \"hotspots\" that can be sporadically identified as X-ray pulsar systems. Additionally, such accretions are able to \"recycle\" old pulsars, causing them to gain mass and rotate extremely quickly, forming millisecond pulsars. Furthermore, binary systems such as these continue to evolve, with many companions eventually becoming compact objects such as white dwarfs or neutron stars themselves, though other possibilities include a complete destruction of the companion through ablation or collision.\nThe study of neutron star systems is central to gravitational wave astronomy. The merger of binary neutron stars produces gravitational waves and may be associated with kilonovae and short-duration gamma-ray burst...",

      "title": "Magnetosphere chronology",
      "content": "The following is a chronology of discoveries concerning the magnetosphere.\n\n1600 - William Gilbert in London suggests the Earth is a giant magnet.\n1741 - Hiorter and Anders Celsius note that the polar aurora is accompanied by a disturbance of the magnetic needle.\n1820 - Hans Christian Ørsted discovers electric currents create magnetic effects. André-Marie Ampère deduces that magnetism is basically the force between electric currents.\n1833 - Carl Friedrich Gauss and Wilhelm Weber worked out the mathematical theory for separating the inner and outer magnetosphere sources of Earth's magnetic field.\n1843 - Samuel Schwabe, a German amateur astronomer, shows the existence of an 11-year sunspot cycle.\n1859 - Richard Carrington in England observes a solar flare;  17 hours later a large magnetic storm begins.\n1892 - George Ellery Hale introduces the spectroheliograph, observing the Sun in hydrogen light from the chromosphere, a sensitive way of detecting flares. He confirms the connection between flares and magnetic storms.\n1900-3 - Kristian Birkeland experiments with beams of electrons aimed at a magnetized sphere (\"terrella\") in a vacuum chamber. The electrons hit near the magnetic poles, leading him to propose that the polar aurora is created by electron beams from the Sun. Birkeland also observes magnetic disturbances associated with the aurora, suggesting to him that localized  \"polar magnetic storms\" exist in the auroral zone.\n1902 - Marconi successfully sends radio signals across the Atlantic Ocean. Oliver Heaviside suggests that the radio waves found their way around the curving Earth because they were reflected from electrically conducting layer at the top of the atmosphere.\n1926 - Gregory Breit and Merle Tuve measure the distance to the conducting layer—which R. Watson-Watt proposes naming \"ionosphere\"—by measuring the time needed for a radio signal to bounce back.\n1930-1 - After Birkeland's \"electron beam\" theory is disproved, Sydney Chapman and Vincent Ferraro in England propose that magnetic storms are caused when plasma clouds ejected from the Sun envelope the Earth.\n1949 - A sudden increase in cosmic rays is traced to an eruption on the Sun. A much larger \"flare event\" occurs on February 23, 1956.\n1953 - Owen Storey proves that \"whistler\" radio waves are produced by lightning and are often guided through distant space along field lines of the Earth's magnetic field.\n1954 - Meredith, Gottlieb and Van Allen use a rocket in the auroral zone to detect radiation from the aurora.\n1957 - Sputnik 1 launched by the Soviet Union, the first artificial satellite.\n1958 - Explorer 1, built by Van Allen and his Iowa group and launched by the US January 31, observes the radiation belt. Explorer 3, launched in March, comes up with the first clear evidence for its existence.\n1958 - Eugene Parker (Chicago) proposes the theory of the solar wind.\n1958 - Pioneer 3 observes the outer radiation belt.\n1958 - Project Argus, 3 small nuclear bombs above the south Atlantic Ocean, creates artificial radiation belts, lasting about 2 weeks. The project also creates artificial aurora.\n1959 - Thomas Gold proposes the name \"Magnetosphere\"\n1961 - James Dungey in Britain proposes a reconnection mechanism for transmitting solar wind energy to the magnetosphere by direct magnetic linkage between the two.\n1961 - Ian Axford and Colin Hines (Canada) raise an alternative possibility, of energization by fluid friction at the boundary between the two.\n1961 - The magnetopause, boundary between magnetosphere and the solar wind, is observed by Explorer 12. The measurements confirm predictions made in 1931 by Chapman and Ferraro.\n1962 - In July, a U.S. H-bomb test (Project Starfish) above the central Pacific Ocean creates a radiation belt of high-energy electrons, parts of which remain until 1967. The new belt creates aurora at Samoa and unexpectedly knocks out 3 artificial satellites.\n1964 - IMP-1 (Interplanetary Monitoring Platform 1) reports a large bow shock formed in the solar wind ahead of the magnetosphere, and a long magnetic tail on the night side of the Earth.\n1964 - Syun-Ichi Akasofu (Japan-U.S.) and Sydney Chapman revive and expand Birkeland's notion of a \"polar magnetic storm\", now named \"magnetic substorm.\"\n1971 - Ionospheric O+ ions found among energetic particles trapped in the Earth's magnetic field, evidence that O+ ions are pulled out of the ionosphere and accelerated\n1972 - Observations of the diffuse aurora are reported, made by the Canadian spacecraft Isis 2.\n1974 - A large-scale pattern of \"Birkeland currents\" between space and the auroral zone traced by Alfred Zmuda and Jim Armstrong, using the Navy's \"Triad\" satellite.\n1974 - David Evans presents evidence that auroral electrons are accelerated within 8000 km or so of Earth.\n1977 - The S3-3 satellite of the U.S. Air Force observes the upward acceleration of O+ ions, related to the downward acceleration of electrons in the polar aurora.\n1981 - High resolution auroral images ar...",

      "title": "Venustiano Carranza",
      "content": "José Venustiano Carranza de la Garza (Spanish pronunciation: [benusˈtjano kaˈransa ðe la ˈɣaɾsa]; 29 December 1859 – 21 May 1920), known as Venustiano Carranza, was a Mexican land owner, revolutionary and politician who served as the 44th President of Mexico from 1917 until his assassination in 1920, during the Mexican Revolution. He was previously Mexico's de facto head of state as Primer Jefe (Spanish: \"First Chief\") of the Constitutionalist faction from 1914 to 1917, and previously served as a senator and governor for Coahuila. He played the leading role in drafting the Constitution of 1917 and maintained Mexican neutrality in World War I.\nBorn in Coahuila to a prominent landowning family, he served as a senator for his state during the Porfiriato, appointed by President and dictator Porfirio Díaz. After becoming alienated from Díaz, he supported the Liberal Francisco Madero's challenge to Díaz during the 1910 presidential election. Madero was defeated in a sham election and imprisoned. Madero ordered an overthrow of the government, sparking the Mexican Revolution, and Díaz resigned in May 1911. As president, Madero appointed Carranza as the governor of Coahuila. When Madero was murdered during the counter-revolutionary Ten Tragic Days coup in February 1913, Carranza drew up the Plan of Guadalupe, a political strategy to oust Madero's usurper, General Victoriano Huerta. Carranza organized militias loyal to his state and allied northern states in Mexico into a professional army, the Constitutional Army, to oppose Huerta. The Constitutionalists defeated Huerta's Federal Army and Huerta was ousted in July 1914. Carranza did not assume the title of provisional president of Mexico, as called for in his Plan of Guadalupe, since it would have prevented his running for constitutional president once elections were held. Furthermore his government in this period was in a pre-constitutional, extralegal state, to which both his best generals, Álvaro Obregón and Pancho Villa, objected to Carranza's seizure of the national presidency.\nFollowing Huerta's defeat, the victors began conflict amongst themselves. Obregón remained loyal to Carranza.  However, Villa broke with him, aligning with peasant leader Emiliano Zapata. Both Zapata and Villa encouraged peasant rebellions in the south and north of Mexico respectively. The Constitutionalist Army under Obregón militarily defeated Villa in the north, and fought guerrilla attacks from Zapata and his peasant army in Morelos. Carranza's position was secure enough politically and militarily to take power in Mexico City, eventually receiving recognition from the United States. The armies of Zapata and Villa formed their own government, the Conventionalists, to oppose Carranza. In order to counter their popularity among the peasantry, Carranza and his allies incorporated many of their demands especially around land reform and labor rights into the Mexican Constitution of 1917, which was the world's first constitution to guarantee social rights under the umbrella of constitutional rights. Under this new constitution Carranza was elected president that same year.\nThe constitution that the revolutionaries drafted and ratified in 1917 now empowered the Mexican state to embark on significant land reform and recognized labor's rights, and curtail the power and influence of the Catholic Church. However, Carranza, a conservative liberal, and Mexican nationalist, did not implement these reforms once he assumed office. Instead he began focusing on internal security by eliminating his political rivals. The Constitutionalists negotiated with Villa to accept the new government in exchange for land and a military pension and Carranza ordered Zapata's assassination in 1919.\nIn the 1920 election, in which he could not succeed himself, Carranza attempted to impose a virtually unknown, civilian politician, Ignacio Bonillas, as president of Mexico. Sonoran revolutionary generals Álvaro Obregón, Plutarco Elías Calles, and Adolfo de la Huerta, who held significant power, rose up against Carranza under the Plan of Agua Prieta. Carranza fled Mexico City, along with thousands of his supporters and with gold of the Mexican treasury, aiming to set up a rival government in Veracruz but he was assassinated in 1920. His contributions were not initially acknowledged in Mexico's historical memory, since he was overthrown by his rivals. Historical evaluations of his leadership have fluctuated as he has been praised for attempting to bring political stability to Mexico and toppling the dictatorship of Huerta. However, he is criticized by some for not enforcing the constitution's social and land reforms. Carranza is buried alongside other prominent revolutionary leaders at the Monument to the Revolution in Mexico City.",

      "title": "Trajectory (fluid mechanics)",
      "content": "In fluid mechanics, meteorology (weather) and oceanography, a trajectory traces the motion of a single point, often called a parcel, in the flow. \nTrajectories are useful for tracking atmospheric contaminants, such as smoke plumes, and as constituents to Lagrangian simulations, such as contour advection or semi-Lagrangian schemes.\nSuppose we have a time-varying flow field, \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              v\n              →\n            \n          \n        \n        (\n        \n          \n            \n              x\n              →\n            \n          \n        \n        ,\n         \n        t\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\vec {v}}({\\vec {x}},~t)}\n  \n.

The first is the integration scheme. This is typically a Runge-Kutta, although others can be useful as well, such as a leapfrog.  The second is the method of determining the velocity vector, \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              v\n              →\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\vec {v}}}\n  \n at a given position, \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              x\n              →\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\vec {x}}}\n  \n, and time, t. Normally, it is not known at all positions and times, therefore some method of interpolation is required.  If the velocities are gridded in space and time, then bilinear, trilinear or higher-dimensional linear interpolation is appropriate. Bicubic, tricubic, etc., interpolation is used as well, but is probably not worth the extra computational overhead.\nVelocity fields can be determined by measurement, e.g. from weather balloons, from numerical models or especially from a combination of the two, e.g. assimilation models.\nThe final concern is metric corrections.

      "title": "Marshall Plan",
      "content": "The Marshall Plan (officially the European Recovery Program, ERP) was an American initiative enacted in 1948 to provide foreign aid to Western Europe. The United States transferred $13.3 billion (equivalent to $133 billion in 2024) in economic recovery programs to Western European economies after the end of World War II in Europe. Replacing an earlier proposal for a Morgenthau Plan, it operated for four years beginning on April 3, 1948, though in 1951, the Marshall Plan was largely replaced by the Mutual Security Act. The goals of the United States were to rebuild war-torn regions, remove trade barriers, modernize industry, improve European prosperity and prevent the spread of communism. The Marshall Plan proposed the reduction of interstate barriers and the economic integration of the European Continent while also encouraging an increase in productivity as well as the adoption of modern business procedures.\nThe Marshall Plan aid was divided among the participant states roughly on a per capita basis. A larger amount was given to the major industrial powers, as the prevailing opinion was that their resuscitation was essential for the general European revival. Somewhat more aid per capita was also directed toward the Allied nations, with less for those that had been part of the Axis or remained neutral. The largest recipient of Marshall Plan money was the United Kingdom (receiving about 26% of the total). The next highest contributions went to France (18%) and West Germany (11%). Some eighteen European countries received Plan benefits. Although offered participation, the Soviet Union refused Plan benefits and also blocked benefits to Eastern Bloc countries, such as Romania and Poland. The United States provided similar aid programs in Asia, but they were not part of the Marshall Plan.\nIts role in rapid recovery has been debated. The Marshall Plan's accounting reflects that aid accounted for about 3% of the combined national income of the recipient countries between 1948 and 1951, which means an increase in GDP growth of less than half a percent.\nGraham T. Allison states that \"the Marshall Plan has become a favorite analogy for policy-makers. Yet few know much about it.\" Some new studies highlight not only the role of economic cooperation but approach the Marshall Plan as a case concerning strategic thinking to face some typical challenges in policy, as problem definition, risk analysis, decision support to policy formulation, and program implementation.\nIn 1947, two years after the end of the war, industrialist Lewis H. Brown wrote, at the request of General Lucius D. Clay, A Report on Germany, which served as a detailed recommendation for the reconstruction of post-war Germany and served as a basis for the Marshall Plan. The initiative was named after United States Secretary of State George C. Marshall. The plan had bipartisan support in Washington, where the Republicans controlled Congress and the Democrats controlled the White House with Harry S. Truman as president. Some businessmen feared the Marshall Plan, unsure whether reconstructing European economies and encouraging foreign competition was in the US' best interests. The plan was largely the creation of State Department officials, especially William L. Clayton and George F. Kennan, with help from the Brookings Institution, as requested by Senator Arthur Vandenberg, chairman of the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. Marshall spoke of an urgent need to help the European recovery in his address at Harvard University in June 1947. The purpose of the Marshall Plan was to aid in the economic recovery of nations after World War II and secure US geopolitical influence over Western Europe. To combat the effects of the Marshall Plan, the USSR developed its own economic recovery program, known as the Molotov Plan. However, the plan was said to have not worked as well due to the USSR particularly having been hit hard by the effects of World War II.\nThe phrase \"equivalent of the Marshall Plan\" is often used to describe a proposed large-scale economic rescue program.",

      "title": "Cosmology episode",
      "content": "A cosmology episode is a sudden loss of meaning, followed eventually by a transformative pivot, which creates the conditions for revised meaning.\nIn the wake of the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, the Vietnam War, the 1977 Tenerife airport disaster, the 1984 Bhopal chemical disaster, and the relatively sudden insertion of personal computers into the workplace, organizational scholar Karl E. Weick coined the term \"cosmology episode,\" as follows, in 1985:\n\"Representations of events normally hang together sensibly within the set of assumptions that give them life and constitute a 'cosmos' rather than its opposite, a 'chaos.'  Sudden losses of meaning that can occur when an event is represented electronically in an incomplete, cryptic form are what I call a 'cosmology episode.'\nRepresentations in the electronic world can become chaotic for at least two reasons:  The data in these representations are flawed, and the people who manage those flawed data have limited processing capacity.  These two problems interact in a potentially deadly vicious circle.\"\nThe concept of cosmology episodes evolved significantly between 1985 and 1993, when Weick published his now-classic reanalysis of Norman Maclean's study of the Mann Gulch wildland firefighting disaster in 1949.  In the 1993 article, Weick positions cosmology episodes within a constructivist ontology, he links the term to a variety of similar concepts, and he provides a better-developed definition than he was able to provide in 1985.\nFirst, Weick makes it clear that cosmology episodes occur within a constructivist ontology of the world, rather than the more familiar objectivist and subjectivist ontologies:\n\"The basic idea of sensemaking is that reality is an ongoing accomplishment that emerges from efforts to create order and make retrospective sense of what occurs...  Sensemaking emphasizes that people try to make things rationally accountable to themselves and others.  Thus, in the words of Morgan, Frost, and Pondy (1983: 24), \"individuals are not seen as living in, and acting out their lives in relations to, a wider reality, so much as creating and sustaining images of a wider reality, in part to rationalize what they are doing.  They realize their reality by 'reading into' their situation patterns of significant meaning.\"\nSecond, Weick clarifies the key phrase \"sudden loss of meaning\" by linking it to related ideas described by other organizational scholars:\n\"Minimal organizations, such as we find in the crew at Mann Gulch, are susceptible to sudden losses of meaning, which have been variably described as fundamental surprises (Reason, 1990) or as events that are inconceivable (Lanir, 1989), hidden (Westrum, 1982), or incomprehensible (Perrow, 1984).\nEach of these labels points to the low probability that the event could occur, which is why it is meaningless.  But these explanations say less about the astonishment of the perceiver, and even less about the perceiver's inability to rebuild some sense of what is happening.\"\nThird, Weick expands his 1985 definition — \"sudden losses of meaning\" — to a more nuanced description:\n\"Cosmology refers to a branch of philosophy often subsumed under metaphysics that combines rational speculation and scientific evidence to understand the universe as a totality of phenomena.  \nCosmology is the ultimate macro perspective, directed at issues of time, space, change, and contingency as they relate to the origin and structure of the universe.  Integrations of these issues, however, are not just the handiwork of philosophers.\nOthers also must make their peace with these issues, as reflected in what they take for granted.  People, including those who are smokejumpers, act as if events cohere in time and space and that change unfolds in an orderly manner.\nThese everyday cosmologies are subject to disruption.  And when they are severely disrupted, I call this a cosmology episode (Weick, 1985: 51-52).  A cosmology episode occurs when people suddenly and deeply feel that the universe is no longer a rational, orderly system.\"",

      "title": "Space Shuttle Columbia",
      "content": "Space Shuttle Columbia (OV-102) was a Space Shuttle orbiter manufactured by Rockwell International and operated by NASA. Named after the first American ship to circumnavigate the globe, and the female personification of the United States, Columbia was the first of five Space Shuttle orbiters to fly in space, debuting the Space Shuttle launch vehicle on its maiden flight on April 12, 1981 and becoming the first spacecraft to be re-used after its first flight when it launched on STS-2 on November 12, 1981. As only the second full-scale orbiter to be manufactured after the Approach and Landing Test vehicle Enterprise, Columbia retained unique external and internal features compared to later orbiters, such as test instrumentation and distinctive black chines. In addition to a heavier aft fuselage and the retention of an internal airlock throughout its lifetime, these made Columbia the heaviest of the five spacefaring orbiters: around 1,000 kilograms (2,200 pounds) heavier than Challenger and 3,600 kilograms (7,900 pounds) heavier than Endeavour when originally constructed. Columbia also carried ejection seats based on those from the SR-71 during its first six flights until 1983, and from 1986 onwards carried an imaging pod on its vertical stabilizer.\nDuring its 22 years of operation, Columbia was flown on 28 missions in the Space Shuttle program, spending over 300 days in space and completing over 4,000 orbits around Earth. NASA's flagship orbiter, Columbia often flew flights dedicated to scientific research in orbit following the loss of Challenger in 1986. Columbia was used for eleven of the fifteen flights of Spacelab laboratories, all four United States Microgravity Payload missions, and the only flight of Spacehab's Research Double Module. Columbia flew many of the longest duration space shuttle missions, all dedicated to scientific research. The only space shuttle that could rival Columbia's long missions was Endeavour, which flew the STS-67 mission that lasted for nearly 17 days. In 1992, NASA modified Columbia to be able to fly some of the longest missions in the Shuttle Program history using the Extended Duration Orbiter pallet. The orbiter used the pallet in thirteen of the pallet's fourteen flights, which aided lengthy stays in orbit for scientific and technological research missions. The longest duration flight of the Shuttle Program, STS-80, was flown with Columbia in 1996, at over 17 days in orbit. Columbia was also used to deploy the first ever satellites into orbit by the Shuttle on STS-5, retrieve the Long Duration Exposure Facility and deploy the Chandra observatory, which was the heaviest payload ever carried by the Space Shuttle. Columbia also carried into space the first female commander of an American spaceflight mission, the first ESA astronaut, the first female astronaut of Indian origin, and the first Israeli astronaut.\nAt the end of its final flight in February 2003, Columbia disintegrated upon reentry, killing the seven-member crew of STS-107 and destroying most of the scientific payloads aboard. The Columbia Accident Investigation Board convened shortly afterwards concluded that damage sustained to the orbiter's left wing during the launch of STS-107 fatally compromised the vehicle's thermal protection system. The loss of Columbia and its crew led to a refocusing of NASA's human exploration programs and led to the establishment of the Constellation program in 2005 and the eventual retirement of the Space Shuttle program in 2011. Numerous memorials and dedications were made to honor the crew following the disaster; the Columbia Memorial Space Center was opened as a national memorial for the accident, and the Columbia Hills in Mars' Gusev crater, which the Spirit rover explored, were named after the crew. The majority of Columbia's recovered remains are stored at the Kennedy Space Center's Vehicle Assembly Building, though some pieces are on public display at the nearby Visitor Complex.",

      "content": "SpaceX Starbase—previously, SpaceX South Texas Launch Site and SpaceX private launch site—is an industrial complex and rocket launch facility that serves as the main testing and production location for Starship launch vehicles, as well as the headquarters of the American space technology company SpaceX. Located in Starbase, Texas, United States, and adjacent to South Padre Island, Texas, Starbase has been under near-continuous development since the late 2010s, and comprises a spaceport near the Gulf of Mexico, a production facility, and a test site along Texas State Highway 4.\nWhen initially conceptualized in the early 2010s, its stated purpose was \"to provide SpaceX an exclusive launch site that would allow the company to accommodate its launch manifest and meet tight launch windows.\" The launch site was originally intended to support launches of the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launch vehicles as well as \"a variety of reusable suborbital launch vehicles\". In early 2018, SpaceX announced a change of plans, stating that the launch site would now be used exclusively for SpaceX's next-generation launch vehicle, Starship. Between 2018 and 2020, the site added significant rocket production and test capacity. SpaceX Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Elon Musk indicated in 2014 that he expected \"commercial astronauts, private astronauts, to be departing from South Texas,\" and eventually launching spacecraft to Mars from the site.\nBetween 2012 and 2014, SpaceX considered seven potential locations around the United States for the new commercial launch facility. For much of this period, a parcel of land adjacent to Boca Chica Beach near Brownsville, Texas, was the leading candidate location, during an extended period while the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) conducted an extensive environmental assessment on the use of the Texas location as a launch site. Also during this period, SpaceX began acquiring land in the area, purchasing approximately 41 acres (170,000 m2) and leasing 57 acres (230,000 m2) by July 2014. SpaceX announced in August 2014 that they had selected the location near Brownsville as the location for the new non-governmental launch site, after the final environmental assessment was completed and environmental agreements were in place by July 2014. In 2023, the first flight test of Starship made it SpaceX's fourth orbital-class launch facility, following three launch locations that are leased from the US government.\nSpaceX conducted a groundbreaking ceremony on the new launch facility in September 2014, and soil preparation began in October 2015. The first tracking antenna was installed in August 2016, and the first propellant tank arrived in July 2018. In late 2018, construction ramped up considerably, and the site saw the fabrication of the first 9 m-diameter (30 ft) prototype test vehicle, Starhopper, which was tested and flown March–August 2019. Through 2021, additional prototype flight vehicles were being built at the facility for higher-altitude tests. By late 2023, over 2,100 full-time employees were working at the site.\nThe development of Starship has resulted in several lawsuits against the FAA and SpaceX from environmental groups. Some conservationists have expressed concern over the impact of Starship's development in Boca Chica, Texas, on species like the critically endangered Kemp's ridley sea-turtle, nearby wildlife habitats and national-refuge land.\nOn December 12, 2024, SpaceX filed an official request to Cameron County authorities to have the site incorporated as a new city, named Starbase. On February 13, 2025, Cameron County judge Eddie Treviño ordered an election on the incorporation petition to be held on May 3. Pending completion of legal formalities, Starbase, Texas will be the first new city in Cameron County since the incorporation of Los Indios in 1995. Voters approved incorporating the new city as Starbase, Texas on May 3, 2025.",

      "content": "The Marshall Islands officially the Republic of the Marshall Islands, is an island country west of the International Date Line and north of the equator in the Micronesia region of the Northwestern Pacific Ocean. \nThe territory consists of 29 coral atolls and five main islands as well as 1,220 other very small ones, divided across two island chains: Ratak in the east and Ralik in the west. 98.13% of its territory is water, the largest proportion of water to land of any sovereign state. The country shares maritime boundaries with Wake Island to the north, Kiribati to the southeast, Nauru to the south, and the Federated States of Micronesia to the west. The capital and largest city is Majuro, home to approximately half of the country's population. The Marshall Islands are one of only four atoll based nations in the entire world.\nAustronesian settlers reached the Marshall Islands as early as the 2nd millennium BC and introduced Southeast Asian crops, including coconuts, giant swamp taro, and breadfruit, as well as domesticated chickens, which made the islands permanently habitable. Several Spanish expeditions visited the islands in the mid-16th century, but Spanish galleons usually sailed a Pacific route farther north and avoided the Marshalls. European maps and charts named the group for British captain John Marshall, who explored the region in 1788. American Protestant missionaries and Western business interests began arriving in the 1850s. German copra traders dominated the economy in the 1870s and 1880s, and the German Empire annexed the Marshalls as a protectorate in 1885. \nThe Empire of Japan occupied the islands in the autumn of 1914 at the beginning of World War I. After the war, the Marshalls and other former German Pacific colonies north of the equator became the Japanese South Seas Mandate. The United States occupied the islands during World War II and administered them as part of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands after the war. Between 1946 and 1958, the United States conducted 67 nuclear tests at Bikini Atoll and Enewetak Atoll.\nThe U.S. government formed the Congress of Micronesia in 1965, a plan for increased self-governance of Pacific islands. In May 1979, the United States gave the Marshall Islands independence by recognizing its constitution and president, Amata Kabua. Full sovereignty or self-government was achieved in a Compact of Free Association with the United States. The Marshall Islands has been a member of the Pacific Community (PC) since 1983 and a United Nations member state since 1991. \nPolitically, the Marshall Islands is a parliamentary republic with an executive presidency in free association with the United States, with the U.S. providing defense, subsidies, and access to U.S.-based agencies such as the Federal Communications Commission and the United States Postal Service. With few natural resources, the islands' wealth is based on a service economy, as well as fishing and agriculture; aid from the United States represents a large percentage of the islands' gross domestic product, and although most financial aid from the Compact of Free Association was set to expire in 2023, it was extended for another 20 years that same year. The country uses the United States dollar as its currency. In 2018, it also announced plans for a new cryptocurrency to be used as legal tender.\nThe majority of the citizens of the Republic of Marshall Islands are of Marshallese descent, though there are small numbers of immigrants from the United States, China, Philippines, and other Pacific islands. The two official languages are Marshallese, which is one of the Oceanic languages, and English. Almost the entire population of the islands practices some religion: three-quarters of the country follows either the United Church of Christ – Congregational in the Marshall Islands (UCCCMI) or the Assemblies of God.",

      "content": "South Korean boy band Big Bang have released eight studio albums, eight extended plays, two reissues, eight compilation albums, ten live albums, seven single albums, and 36 singles. As of May 2017, the group has sold over 4.3 million physical albums in South Korea and Japan alone.\nBigBang's debut studio album was released in December 2006. It spawned several singles, including \"La La La\" and \"A Fool's Only Tears\". The group achieved commercial success with \"Lies\", the lead single of their first extended play, Always (2007), which topped the Melon Chart for six consecutive weeks. Their second and third extended plays followed their predecessor's success; Hot Issue (2007) yielded \"Last Farewell\" while Stand Up (2008) spawned \"Haru Haru\", which topped the Melon Chart for eight and seven consecutive weeks, respectively. Their second studio album, Remember (2008), was also a commercial success and yielded two hit singles in South Korea, \"Sunset Glow\" and \"Strong Baby\", with the latter being performed solely by member Seungri.\nThe group ventured into the Japanese market with two extended plays, For the World (2008) and With U (2008), as well as two studio albums, Number 1 (2009) and Big Bang (2009). The latter was promoted with two singles: \"My Heaven\", which debuted at number three on the Oricon Chart, and \"Gara Gara Go!\", which was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ).\nThey resumed their activities in South Korea in early 2009, with the release of the song \"Lollipop\" with their labelmate 2NE1, which was used to promote the LG Cyon's Lollipop phone. The song topped various online charts in South Korea and became an instant viral hit. In February 2011, BigBang returned to the Korean music scene after two years of hiatus with the release of their fourth Korean extended play, Tonight, which became their first number-one album on the Gaon Album Chart, which was established one year prior. The EP spawned a chart-topping single of the same name and was reissued as a repackaged album under the title Big Bang Special Edition, which spawned \"Love Song\", their second number-one hit. Later in the same year, BigBang released their second Japanese studio album, Big Bang 2 (2011), which topped the Oricon Albums Charts and was certified gold by the RIAJ. Two singles from the album, \"Koe o Kikasete\" and \"Tell Me Goodbye\", also received the same certification.\nIn 2012, BigBang released their fifth Korean extended play, Alive, which made the group the first ever Korean act to chart on the Billboard 200 with an album purely in the Korean language, debuting at number 150. The EP's lead single, \"Blue\", quickly topped all major music charts in South Korea while the next two singles, \"Bad Boy\" and \"Fantastic Baby\", charted at number two and three on the Gaon Digital Chart, respectively. All three singles from Alive charted separately at number three on the Billboard World Song Sales chart. The EP was later reissued under the title Still Alive (2012), which spawned the single \"Monster\", their fourth number-one hit on the Gaon Digital Chart.\nAfter a three-year hiatus, BigBang made their comeback in mid-2015 by releasing four single albums from their first studio album in eight years, Made (2016). All songs from the album charted within the top three positions on the Gaon Digital Chart and Billboard World Digital Songs chart (with the exception of \"Girlfriend\"). BigBang's final release as a five-member group, \"Flower Road\", topped both the Gaon Digital Chart and the Billboard World Digital Songs chart in March 2018. It was eventually certified platinum by the Korea Music Content Association. In 2022, BigBang released the single \"Still Life\" as a four-member group, which topped the charts in South Korea, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam.",

      "content": "Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. This is enabled by Earth being an ocean world, the only one in the Solar System sustaining liquid surface water. Almost all of Earth's water is contained in its global ocean, covering 70.8% of Earth's crust. The remaining 29.2% of Earth's crust is land, most of which is located in the form of continental landmasses within Earth's land hemisphere. Most of Earth's land is at least somewhat humid and covered by vegetation, while large sheets of ice at Earth's polar deserts retain more water than Earth's groundwater, lakes, rivers, and atmospheric water combined. Earth's crust consists of slowly moving tectonic plates, which interact to produce mountain ranges, volcanoes, and earthquakes. Earth has a liquid outer core that generates a magnetosphere capable of deflecting most of the destructive solar winds and cosmic radiation.\nEarth has a dynamic atmosphere, which sustains Earth's surface conditions and protects it from most meteoroids and UV-light at entry. It has a composition of primarily nitrogen and oxygen. Water vapor is widely present in the atmosphere, forming clouds that cover most of the planet. The water vapor acts as a greenhouse gas and, together with other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2), creates the conditions for both liquid surface water and water vapor to persist via the capturing of energy from the Sun's light. This process maintains the current average surface temperature of 14.76 °C (58.57 °F), at which water is liquid under normal atmospheric pressure. Differences in the amount of captured energy between geographic regions (as with the equatorial region receiving more sunlight than the polar regions) drive atmospheric and ocean currents, producing a global climate system with different climate regions, and a range of weather phenomena such as precipitation, allowing components such as carbon and nitrogen to cycle.\nEarth is rounded into an ellipsoid with a circumference of about 40,000 kilometres (25,000 miles). It is the densest planet in the Solar System. Of the four rocky planets, it is the largest and most massive. Earth is about eight light-minutes (1 AU) away from the Sun and orbits it, taking a year (about 365.25 days) to complete one revolution. Earth rotates around its own axis in slightly less than a day (in about 23 hours and 56 minutes). Earth's axis of rotation is tilted with respect to the perpendicular to its orbital plane around the Sun, producing seasons. Earth is orbited by one permanent natural satellite, the Moon, which orbits Earth at 384,400 km (238,900 mi)—1.28 light seconds—and is roughly a quarter as wide as Earth. The Moon's gravity helps stabilize Earth's axis, causes tides and gradually slows Earth's rotation. Likewise Earth's gravitational pull has already made the Moon's rotation tidally locked, keeping the same near side facing Earth.\nEarth, like most other bodies in the Solar System, formed about 4.5 billion years ago from gas and dust in the early Solar System. During the first billion years of Earth's history, the ocean formed and then life developed within it. Life spread globally and has been altering Earth's atmosphere and surface, leading to the Great Oxidation Event two billion years ago. Humans emerged 300,000 years ago in Africa and have spread across every continent on Earth. Humans depend on Earth's biosphere and natural resources for their survival, but have increasingly impacted the planet's environment. Humanity's current impact on Earth's climate and biosphere is unsustainable, threatening the livelihood of humans and many other forms of life, and causing widespread extinctions.",

      "title": "Callisto (moon)",
      "content": "Callisto ( kə-LIST-oh) is the second-largest moon of Jupiter, after Ganymede. In the Solar System it is the third-largest moon after Ganymede and Saturn's largest moon Titan, and nearly as large as the smallest planet Mercury. Callisto is, with a diameter of 4,821 km, roughly a third larger than Earth's Moon and orbits Jupiter on average at a distance of 1,883,000 km, which is about five times further out than the Moon orbiting Earth. It is the outermost of the four large Galilean moons of Jupiter, which were discovered in 1610 with one of the first telescopes, and is today visible from Earth with common binoculars.\nThe surface of Callisto is the oldest and most heavily cratered in the Solar System. Its surface is completely covered with impact craters. It does not show any signatures of subsurface processes such as plate tectonics or volcanism, with no signs that geological activity in general has ever occurred, and is thought to have evolved predominantly under the influence of impacts. Prominent surface features include multi-ring structures, variously shaped impact craters, and chains of craters (catenae) and associated scarps, ridges and deposits. At a small scale, the surface is varied and made up of small, sparkly frost deposits at the tips of high spots, surrounded by a low-lying, smooth blanket of dark material. This is thought to result from the sublimation-driven degradation of small landforms, which is supported by the general deficit of small impact craters and the presence of numerous small knobs, considered to be their remnants. The absolute ages of the landforms are not known.\nCallisto is composed of approximately equal amounts of rock and ice, with a density of about 1.83 g/cm3, the lowest density and surface gravity of Jupiter's major moons. Compounds detected spectroscopically on the surface include water ice, carbon dioxide, silicates and organic compounds. Investigation by the Galileo spacecraft revealed that Callisto may have a small silicate core and possibly a subsurface ocean of liquid water at depths greater than 100 km.\nIt is not in an orbital resonance like the three other Galilean satellites—Io, Europa and Ganymede—and is thus not appreciably tidally heated. Callisto's rotation is tidally locked to its orbit around Jupiter, so that it always faces the same direction, making Jupiter appear to hang directly overhead over its near-side. It is less affected by Jupiter's magnetosphere than the other inner satellites because of its more remote orbit, located just outside Jupiter's main radiation belt. Callisto is surrounded by an extremely thin atmosphere composed of carbon dioxide and probably molecular oxygen, as well as by a rather intense ionosphere. Callisto is thought to have formed by slow accretion from the disk of the gas and dust that surrounded Jupiter after its formation. Callisto's gradual accretion and the lack of tidal heating meant that not enough heat was available for rapid differentiation. The slow convection in the interior of Callisto, which commenced soon after formation, led to partial differentiation and possibly to the formation of a subsurface ocean at a depth of 100–150 km and a small, rocky core.\nThe likely presence of an ocean within Callisto leaves open the possibility that it could harbor life. However, conditions are thought to be less favorable than on nearby Europa. Various space probes from Pioneers 10 and 11 to Galileo and Cassini have studied Callisto. Because of its low radiation levels, Callisto has long been considered the most suitable to base possible future crewed missions on to study the Jovian system.",

      "title": "Evander Holyfield",
      "content": "Evander Holyfield (born October 19, 1962) is an American former professional boxer who competed between 1984 and 2011. He reigned as the undisputed champion in the cruiserweight division in the late 1980s and at heavyweight in the early 1990s, and was the only boxer in history to win the undisputed championship in two weight classes in the \"three-belt era\", a feat later surpassed by Terence Crawford, Naoya Inoue and Oleksandr Usyk, who became two-weight undisputed champions in the four-belt era. Nicknamed \"the Real Deal\", Holyfield is the only four-time world heavyweight champion, having held the unified World Boxing Association (WBA), World Boxing Council (WBC), and International Boxing Federation (IBF) titles from 1990 to 1992, the WBA and IBF titles again from 1993 to 1994, the WBA title a third time from 1996 to 1999; the IBF title a third time from 1997 to 1999 and the WBA title for a fourth time from 2000 to 2001.\nAs an amateur, Holyfield represented the United States at the 1984 Summer Olympics, winning the light heavyweight bronze medal. He turned professional at the age of 21, moving up to cruiserweight in 1985 and winning his first world championship the following year, defeating Dwight Muhammad Qawi for the WBA title. Holyfield then went on to defeat Ricky Parkey and Carlos de León to win the WBC and IBF titles, thus becoming the undisputed cruiserweight champion. He moved up to heavyweight in 1988, later defeating Buster Douglas in 1990 to claim the unified WBA, WBC and IBF heavyweight titles and the undisputed heavyweight championship.\nHe successfully defended his titles three times, scoring victories over former champions George Foreman and Larry Holmes, before suffering his first professional loss to Riddick Bowe in 1992. Holyfield regained the crown in a rematch one year later, defeating Bowe for the WBA and IBF titles (Bowe having relinquished the WBC title beforehand). Holyfield later lost these titles in an upset against Michael Moorer in 1994.\nHolyfield was forced to retire in 1994 upon medical advice, only to return a year later with a clean bill of health. In 1996, he defeated Mike Tyson and reclaimed the WBA title, in what was named by The Ring magazine as the Fight of the Year and Upset of the Year. This made Holyfield the first boxer since Muhammad Ali to win a world heavyweight title three times. Holyfield won a 1997 rematch against Tyson, which saw the latter disqualified in round three for biting off part of Holyfield's ears. During this reign as champion, he also avenged his loss to Michael Moorer and reclaimed the IBF title.\nIn 1999, he faced Lennox Lewis in a unification fight for the undisputed WBA, WBC, and IBF titles, which ended in a controversial split draw. Holyfield was defeated in a rematch eight months later. The following year, he defeated John Ruiz for the vacant WBA title, becoming the first boxer in history to win a version of the heavyweight title four times. Holyfield lost a rematch against Ruiz seven months later and faced him for the third time in a draw.\nHolyfield retired in 2014, and is ranked number 77 on The Ring's list of 100 greatest punchers of all time and in 2002 named him the 22nd greatest fighter of the past 80 years. He currently ranks No.91 in BoxRec's ranking of the greatest pound for pound boxers of all time. BoxingScene ranked him the greatest cruiserweight of all time. He is also the first boxer to hold world titles in three different decades, in the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s. In 2015, he was inducted into the International Sports Hall of Fame.",

      "title": "Nebular hypothesis",
      "content": "The nebular hypothesis is the most widely accepted model in the field of cosmogony to explain the formation and evolution of the Solar System (as well as other planetary systems). It suggests the Solar System is formed from gas and dust orbiting the Sun which clumped up together to form the planets. The theory was developed by Immanuel Kant and published in his Universal Natural History and Theory of the Heavens (1755) and then modified in 1796 by Pierre Laplace. Originally applied to the Solar System, the process of planetary system formation is now thought to be at work throughout the universe. The widely accepted modern variant of the nebular theory is the solar nebular disk model (SNDM) or solar nebular model. It offered explanations for a variety of properties of the Solar System, including the nearly circular and coplanar orbits of the planets, and their motion in the same direction as the Sun's rotation. Some elements of the original nebular theory are echoed in modern theories of planetary formation, but most elements have been superseded.\nAccording to the nebular theory, stars form in massive and dense clouds of molecular hydrogen—giant molecular clouds (GMC). These clouds are gravitationally unstable, and matter coalesces within them to smaller denser clumps, which then rotate, collapse, and form stars. Star formation is a complex process, which always produces a gaseous protoplanetary disk (proplyd) around the young star. This may give birth to planets in certain circumstances, which are not well known. Thus the formation of planetary systems is thought to be a natural result of star formation. A Sun-like star usually takes approximately 1 million years to form, with the protoplanetary disk evolving into a planetary system over the next 10–100 million years.\nThe protoplanetary disk is an accretion disk that feeds the central star. Initially very hot, the disk later cools in what is known as the T Tauri star stage; here, formation of small dust grains made of rocks and ice is possible. The grains eventually may coagulate into kilometer-sized planetesimals. If the disk is massive enough, the runaway accretions begin, resulting in the rapid—100,000 to 300,000 years—formation of Moon- to Mars-sized planetary embryos. Near the star, the planetary embryos go through a stage of violent mergers, producing a few terrestrial planets. The last stage takes approximately 100 million to a billion years.\nThe formation of giant planets is a more complicated process. It is thought to occur beyond the frost line, where planetary embryos mainly are made of various types of ice. As a result, they are several times more massive than in the inner part of the protoplanetary disk. What follows after the embryo formation is not completely clear. Some embryos appear to continue to grow and eventually reach 5–10 Earth masses—the threshold value, which is necessary to begin accretion of the hydrogen–helium gas from the disk. The accumulation of gas by the core is initially a slow process, which continues for several million years, but after the forming protoplanet reaches about 30 Earth masses (M🜨) it accelerates and proceeds in a runaway manner. Jupiter- and Saturn-like planets are thought to accumulate the bulk of their mass during only 10,000 years. The accretion stops when the gas is exhausted. The formed planets can migrate over long distances during or after their formation. Ice giants such as Uranus and Neptune are thought to be failed cores, which formed too late when the disk had almost disappeared.",

      "title": "Venus",
      "content": "Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is often called Earth's \"twin\" or \"sister\" among the planets of the Solar System for its orbit being the closest to Earth's, both being rocky planets and having the most similar and nearly equal size and mass. Venus, though, differs significantly by having no liquid water, and its atmosphere is far thicker and denser than that of any other rocky body in the Solar System. It is composed of mostly carbon dioxide and has a cloud layer of sulfuric acid that spans the whole planet. At the mean surface level, the atmosphere reaches a temperature of 737 K (464 °C; 867 °F) and a pressure 92 times greater than Earth's at sea level, turning the lowest layer of the atmosphere into a supercritical fluid.\nFrom Earth Venus is visible as a star-like point of light, appearing brighter than any other natural point of light in Earth's sky, and as an inferior planet always relatively close to the Sun, either as the brightest \"morning star\" or \"evening star\".\nThe orbits of Venus and Earth make the two planets approach each other in synodic periods of 1.6 years. In the course of this, Venus comes closer to Earth than any other planet, while on average Mercury stays closer to Earth and any other planet, due to its orbit being closer to the Sun. For interplanetary spaceflights, Venus is frequently used as a waypoint for gravity assists because it offers a more economical and faster route. Venus has no moons and has a very slow retrograde rotation about its axis, a result of competing forces of solar tidal locking and differential heating of Venus's massive atmosphere. As a result a Venusian day is 116.75 Earth days long, about half a Venusian solar year, which is 224.7 Earth days long.\nVenus has a weak magnetosphere, lacking an internal dynamo it is induced by the solar wind interacting with the atmosphere.\nInternally, Venus has a core, mantle, and crust. Internal heat escapes through active volcanism, resulting in resurfacing, instead of plate tectonics. Venus may have had liquid surface water early in its history with a habitable environment, before a runaway greenhouse effect evaporated any water and turned Venus into its present state. Conditions at the cloud layer of Venus have been identified as possibly favourable for life on Venus, with possible biomarkers having been found in 2020, which has spurred new research and missions to Venus.\nHumans have observed Venus throughout history across the globe, acquiring particular importance in many cultures. With telescopes, the phases of Venus became discernible and, by 1613, were presented as decisive evidence disproving the then-dominant geocentric model and supporting the heliocentric model. Venus was visited for the first time in 1961 by Venera 1, which flew past the planet, achieving the first interplanetary spaceflight. The first data from Venus were returned during the second interplanetary mission, Mariner 2, in 1962. In 1967, the first interplanetary impactor, Venera 4, reached Venus, followed by the lander Venera 7 in 1970. The data from these missions revealed the strong greenhouse effect of carbon dioxide in its atmosphere, which raised concerns about increasing carbon dioxide levels in Earth's atmosphere and their role in driving climate change. As of 2025, JUICE and Solar Orbiter are on their way to fly-by Venus in 2025 and 2026 respectively, and the next mission planned to launch to Venus is the Venus Life Finder scheduled for 2026.",

      "title": "Starship Troopers",
      "content": "Starship Troopers is a military science fiction novel by American writer Robert A. Heinlein. Written in a few weeks in reaction to the US suspending nuclear tests, the story was first published as a two-part serial in The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction as Starship Soldier, and published as a book by G. P. Putnam's Sons on November 5, 1959.\nThe story is set in a future society ruled by a human interstellar government called the Terran Federation, dominated by a military elite. Under the Terran Federation, only veterans of a primarily military Federal Service enjoy full citizenship, including the right to vote. The first-person narrative follows Juan \"Johnny\" Rico, a young man of Filipino descent, through his military service in the Mobile Infantry. He progresses from recruit to officer against the backdrop of an interstellar war between humans and an alien species known as \"Arachnids\" or \"Bugs\". Interspersed with the primary plot are classroom scenes in which Rico and others discuss philosophical and moral issues, including aspects of suffrage, civic virtue, juvenile delinquency, and war; these discussions have been described as expounding Heinlein's own political views. Identified with a tradition of militarism in US science fiction, the novel draws parallels between the conflict between humans and the Bugs, and the Cold War. It is also a coming-of-age novel, which criticizes the US society of the 1950s, arguing that a lack of discipline had led to a moral decline, and advocating corporal and capital punishment.\nStarship Troopers brought to an end Heinlein's series of juvenile novels. It won the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 1960, and was praised by reviewers for its scenes of training and combat and its visualization of a future military. It also became enormously controversial because of the political views it seemed to support. Reviewers were strongly critical of the book's intentional glorification of the military, an aspect described as propaganda and likened to recruitment. The novel's militarism, and the fact that government service – most often military service – was a prerequisite to the right to vote in the novel, led to it being frequently described as fascist. Others disagree, arguing that Heinlein was only exploring the idea of limiting the right to vote to a certain group of people. Heinlein's depiction of gender has also been questioned, while reviewers have said that the terms used to describe the aliens were akin to racial epithets.\nStarship Troopers had wide influence both within and outside science fiction. Ken MacLeod stated that \"the political strand in [science fiction] can be described as a dialogue with Heinlein\". Science fiction critic Darko Suvin wrote that it is the \"ancestral text of US science fiction militarism\" and that it shaped the debate about the role of the military in society for many years. The novel is credited with popularizing the idea of powered armor, which became a recurring feature in science fiction books and films, as well as an object of scientific research. Heinlein's depiction of a futuristic military was also influential. Later science fiction books, such as Joe Haldeman's 1974 anti-war novel The Forever War, have been described as reactions to Starship Troopers. The story was adapted several times, including in a 1997 film version directed by Paul Verhoeven that satirized what the director saw as the fascist aspects of the novel.",

      "title": "Mathematics education in the United States",
      "content": "Mathematics education in the United States varies considerably from one state to the next, and even within a single state. With the adoption of the Common Core Standards in most states and the District of Columbia beginning in 2010, mathematics content across the country has moved into closer agreement for each grade level. The SAT, a standardized university entrance exam, has been reformed to better reflect the contents of the Common Core.\nMany students take alternatives to the traditional pathways, including accelerated tracks. As of 2023, twenty-seven states require students to pass three math courses before graduation from high school (grades 9 to 12, for students typically aged 14 to 18), while seventeen states and the District of Columbia require four. A typical sequence of secondary-school (grades 6 to 12) courses in mathematics reads: Pre-Algebra (7th or 8th grade), Algebra I, Geometry, Algebra II, Pre-calculus, and Calculus or Statistics. Some students enroll in integrated programs while many complete high school without taking Calculus or Statistics.\nCounselors at competitive public or private high schools usually encourage talented and ambitious students to take Calculus regardless of future plans in order to increase their chances of getting admitted to a prestigious university and their parents enroll them in enrichment programs in mathematics. \nSecondary-school algebra proves to be the turning point of difficulty many students struggle to surmount, and as such, many students are ill-prepared for collegiate programs in the sciences, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), or future high-skilled careers. According to a 1997 report by the U.S. Department of Education, passing rigorous high-school mathematics courses predicts successful completion of university programs regardless of major or family income. Meanwhile, the number of eighth-graders enrolled in Algebra I has fallen between the early 2010s and early 2020s. Across the United States, there is a shortage of qualified mathematics instructors. Despite their best intentions, parents may transmit their mathematical anxiety to their children, who may also have school teachers who fear mathematics, and they overestimate their children's mathematical proficiency. As of 2013, about one in five American adults were functionally innumerate. By 2025, the number of American adults unable to \"use mathematical reasoning when reviewing and evaluating the validity of statements\" stood at 35%.\nWhile an overwhelming majority agree that mathematics is important, many, especially the young, are not confident of their own mathematical ability. On the other hand, high-performing schools may offer their students accelerated tracks (including the possibility of taking collegiate courses after calculus) and nourish them for mathematics competitions. At the tertiary level, student interest in STEM has grown considerably. However, many students find themselves having to take remedial courses for high-school mathematics and many drop out of STEM programs due to deficient mathematical skills.\nCompared to other developed countries in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the average level of mathematical literacy of American students is mediocre. As in many other countries, math scores dropped during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, Asian- and European-American students are above the OECD average.",

      "title": "Mars",
      "content": "Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun. It is also known as the \"Red Planet\", because of its orange-red appearance. Mars is a desert-like rocky planet with a tenuous carbon dioxide (CO2) atmosphere. At the average surface level the atmospheric pressure is a few thousandths of Earth's, atmospheric temperature ranges from −153 to 20 °C (−243 to 68 °F) and cosmic radiation is high. Mars retains some water, in the ground as well as thinly in the atmosphere, forming cirrus clouds, frost, larger polar regions of permafrost and ice caps (with seasonal CO2 snow), but no liquid surface water. Its surface gravity is roughly a third of Earth's or double that of the Moon. It is half as wide as Earth or twice the Moon, with a diameter of 6,779 km (4,212 mi), and has a surface area the size of all the dry land of Earth.\nFine dust is prevalent across the surface and the atmosphere, being picked up and spread at the low Martian gravity even by the weak wind of the tenuous atmosphere.\nThe terrain of Mars roughly follows a north-south divide, the Martian dichotomy, with the northern hemisphere mainly consisting of relatively flat, low lying plains, and the southern hemisphere of cratered highlands. Geologically, the planet is fairly active with marsquakes trembling underneath the ground, but also hosts many enormous extinct volcanoes (the tallest is Olympus Mons, 21.9 km or 13.6 mi tall) and one of the largest canyons in the Solar System (Valles Marineris, 4,000 km or 2,500 mi long). Mars has two natural satellites that are small and irregular in shape: Phobos and Deimos. With a significant axial tilt of 25 degrees Mars experiences seasons, like Earth (which has an axial tilt of 23.5 degrees). A Martian solar year is equal to 1.88 Earth years (687 Earth days), a Martian solar day (sol) is equal to 24.6 hours.\nMars was formed approximately 4.5 billion years ago. During the Noachian period (4.5 to 3.5 billion years ago), its surface was marked by meteor impacts, valley formation, erosion, the possible presence of water oceans and the loss of its magnetosphere. The Hesperian period (beginning 3.5 billion years ago and ending 3.3–2.9 billion years ago) was dominated by widespread volcanic activity and flooding that carved immense outflow channels. The Amazonian period, which continues to the present is the currently dominating and remaining influence on geological processes. Due to Mars's geological history, the possibility of past or present life on Mars remains an area of active scientific investigation.\nBeing visible with the naked eye in Earth's sky as a red wandering star, Mars has been observed throughout history, acquiring diverse associations in different cultures. In 1963 the first flight to Mars took place with Mars 1, but communication was lost en route. The first successful flyby exploration of Mars was conducted in 1965 with Mariner 4. In 1971 Mariner 9 entered orbit around Mars, being the first spacecraft to orbit any body other than the Moon, Sun or Earth; following in the same year were the first uncontrolled impact (Mars 2) and first landing (Mars 3) on Mars. Probes have been active on Mars continuously since 1997; at times, more than ten probes have simultaneously operated in orbit or on the surface, more than at any other planet beside Earth. Mars is an often proposed target for future human exploration missions, though no such mission is planned yet.",

      "title": "Satellite",
      "content": "A satellite or an artificial satellite is an object, typically a spacecraft, placed into orbit around a celestial body. They have a variety of uses, including communication relay, weather forecasting, navigation (GPS), broadcasting, scientific research, and Earth observation. Additional military uses are reconnaissance, early warning, signals intelligence and, potentially, weapon delivery. Other satellites include the final rocket stages that place satellites in orbit and formerly useful satellites that later become defunct.\nExcept for passive satellites, most satellites have an electricity generation system for equipment on board, such as solar panels or radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs). Most satellites also have a method of communication to ground stations, called transponders. Many satellites use a standardized bus to save cost and work, the most popular of which are small CubeSats. Similar satellites can work together as groups, forming constellations. Because of the high launch cost to space, most satellites are designed to be as lightweight and robust as possible. Most communication satellites are radio relay stations in orbit and carry dozens of transponders, each with a bandwidth of tens of megahertz.\nSpaceships become satellites by accelerating or decelerating to reach orbital velocities, occupying an orbit high enough to avoid orbital decay due to drag in the presence of an atmosphere and above their Roche limit. Satellites are spacecraft launched from the surface into space by launch systems. Satellites can then change or maintain their orbit by propulsion, usually by chemical or ion thrusters. As of 2018, about 90% of the satellites orbiting the Earth are in low Earth orbit or geostationary orbit; geostationary means the satellites stay still in the sky (relative to a fixed point on the ground). Some imaging satellites choose a Sun-synchronous orbit because they can scan the entire globe with similar lighting. As the number of satellites and amount of space debris around Earth increases, the threat of collision has become more severe. An orbiter is a spacecraft that is designed to perform an orbital insertion, entering orbit around an astronomical body from another, and as such becoming an artificial satellite. A small number of satellites orbit other bodies (such as the Moon, Mars, and the Sun) or many bodies at once (two for a halo orbit, three for a Lissajous orbit).\nEarth observation satellites gather information for reconnaissance, mapping, monitoring the weather, ocean, forest, etc. Space telescopes take advantage of outer space's near perfect vacuum to observe objects with the entire electromagnetic spectrum. Because satellites can see a large portion of the Earth at once, communications satellites can relay information to remote places. The signal delay from satellites and their orbit's predictability are used in satellite navigation systems, such as GPS. Crewed spacecrafts which are in orbit or remain in orbit, like Space stations, are artificial satellites as well.\nThe first artificial satellite launched into the Earth's orbit was the Soviet Union's Sputnik 1, on October 4, 1957. As of December 31, 2022, there are 6,718 operational satellites in the Earth's orbit, of which 4,529 belong to the United States (3,996 commercial), 590 belong to China, 174 belong to Russia, and 1,425 belong to other nations.",

      "title": "Uranium",
      "content": "Uranium is a chemical element; it has symbol U and atomic number 92. It is a silvery-grey metal in the actinide series of the periodic table. A uranium atom has 92 protons and 92 electrons, of which 6 are valence electrons. Uranium radioactively decays, usually by emitting an alpha particle. The half-life of this decay varies between 159,200 and 4.5 billion years for different isotopes, making them useful for dating the age of the Earth. The most common isotopes in natural uranium are uranium-238 (which has 146 neutrons and accounts for over 99% of uranium on Earth) and uranium-235 (which has 143 neutrons). Uranium has the highest atomic weight of the primordially occurring elements. Its density is about 70% higher than that of lead and slightly lower than that of gold or tungsten. It occurs naturally in low concentrations of a few parts per million in soil, rock and water, and is commercially extracted from uranium-bearing minerals such as uraninite.\nMany contemporary uses of uranium exploit its unique nuclear properties. Uranium is used in nuclear power plants and nuclear weapons because it is the only naturally occurring element with a fissile isotope – uranium-235 – present in non-trace amounts. However, because of the low abundance of uranium-235 in natural uranium (which is overwhelmingly uranium-238), uranium needs to undergo enrichment so that enough uranium-235 is present. Uranium-238 is fissionable by fast neutrons and is fertile, meaning it can be transmuted to fissile plutonium-239 in a nuclear reactor. Another fissile isotope, uranium-233, can be produced from natural thorium and is studied for future industrial use in nuclear technology. Uranium-238 has a small probability for spontaneous fission or even induced fission with fast neutrons; uranium-235, and to a lesser degree uranium-233, have a much higher fission cross-section for slow neutrons. In sufficient concentration, these isotopes maintain a sustained nuclear chain reaction. This generates the heat in nuclear power reactors and produces the fissile material for nuclear weapons.  The primary civilian use for uranium harnesses the heat energy to produce electricity. Depleted uranium (238U) is used in kinetic energy penetrators and armor plating.\nThe 1789 discovery of uranium in the mineral pitchblende is credited to Martin Heinrich Klaproth, who named the new element after the recently discovered planet Uranus. Eugène-Melchior Péligot was the first person to isolate the metal, and its radioactive properties were discovered in 1896 by Henri Becquerel. Research by Otto Hahn, Lise Meitner, Enrico Fermi and others, such as J. Robert Oppenheimer starting in 1934 led to its use as a fuel in the nuclear power industry and in Little Boy, the first nuclear weapon used in war. An ensuing arms race during the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union produced tens of thousands of nuclear weapons that used uranium metal and uranium-derived plutonium-239. Dismantling of these weapons and related nuclear facilities is carried out within various nuclear disarmament programs and costs billions of dollars. Weapon-grade uranium obtained from nuclear weapons is diluted with uranium-238 and reused as fuel for nuclear reactors. Spent nuclear fuel forms radioactive waste, which mostly consists of uranium-238 and poses a significant health threat and environmental impact.",

      "title": "Space Shuttle Challenger disaster",
      "content": "On January 28, 1986, Space Shuttle Challenger broke apart 73 seconds into its flight, killing all seven crew members aboard. The spacecraft disintegrated 46,000 feet (14 km) above the Atlantic Ocean, off the coast of Cape Canaveral, Florida, at 16:39:13 UTC (11:39:13 a.m. EST, local time at the launch site). It was the first fatal accident involving an American spacecraft while in flight.\nThe mission, designated STS-51-L, was the 10th flight for the orbiter and the 25th flight of the Space Shuttle fleet. The crew was scheduled to deploy a commercial communications satellite and study Halley's Comet while they were in orbit, in addition to taking schoolteacher Christa McAuliffe into space under the Teacher in Space Project. The latter task resulted in a higher-than-usual media interest in and coverage of the mission; the launch and subsequent disaster were seen live in many schools across the United States.\nThe cause of the disaster was the failure of the primary and secondary O-ring seals in a joint in the right Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster (SRB). The record-low temperatures on the morning of the launch had stiffened the rubber O-rings, reducing their ability to seal the joints. Shortly after liftoff, the seals were breached, and hot pressurized gas from within the SRB leaked through the joint and burned through the aft attachment strut connecting it to the external propellant tank (ET), then into the tank itself. The collapse of the ET's internal structures and the rotation of the SRB that followed propelled the shuttle stack, traveling at a speed of Mach 1.92, into a direction that allowed aerodynamic forces to tear the orbiter apart. Both SRBs detached from the now-destroyed ET and continued to fly uncontrollably until the range safety officer destroyed them.\nThe crew compartment, containing human remains, and many other fragments from the shuttle were recovered from the ocean floor after a three-month search and recovery operation. The exact timing of the deaths of the crew is unknown, but several crew members are thought to have survived the initial breakup of the spacecraft. The orbiter had no escape system, and the impact of the crew compartment at terminal velocity with the ocean surface was too violent to be survivable.\nThe disaster resulted in a 32-month hiatus in the Space Shuttle program. President Ronald Reagan created the Rogers Commission to investigate the accident. The commission criticized NASA's organizational culture and decision-making processes that had contributed to the accident. Test data since 1977 had demonstrated a potentially catastrophic flaw in the SRBs' O-rings, but neither NASA nor SRB manufacturer Morton Thiokol had addressed this known defect. NASA managers also disregarded engineers' warnings about the dangers of launching in low temperatures and did not report these technical concerns to their superiors.\nAs a result of this disaster, NASA established the Office of Safety, Reliability, and Quality Assurance, and arranged for deployment of commercial satellites from expendable launch vehicles rather than from a crewed orbiter. To replace Challenger, the construction of a new Space Shuttle orbiter, Endeavour, was approved in 1987, and the new orbiter first flew in 1992. Subsequent missions were launched with redesigned SRBs and their crews wore pressurized suits during ascent and reentry.",

      "title": "Space Race",
      "content": "The Space Race (Russian: космическая гонка, romanized: kosmicheskaya gonka, IPA: [kɐsˈmʲitɕɪskəjə ˈɡonkə]) was a 20th-century competition between the Cold War rivals, the United States and the Soviet Union, to achieve superior spaceflight capability. It had its origins in the ballistic missile-based nuclear arms race between the two nations following World War II and the onset of the Cold War. The technological advantage demonstrated by spaceflight achievement was seen as necessary for national security, particularly in regard to intercontinental ballistic missile and satellite reconnaissance capability, but also became part of the cultural symbolism and ideology of the time. The Space Race brought pioneering launches of artificial satellites, robotic landers to the Moon, Venus, and Mars, and human spaceflight in low Earth orbit and ultimately to the Moon.\nPublic interest in space travel originated in the 1951 publication of a Soviet youth magazine and was promptly picked up by US magazines. The competition began on July 29, 1955, when the United States announced its intent to launch artificial satellites for the International Geophysical Year. Five days later, the Soviet Union responded by declaring they would also launch a satellite \"in the near future\". The launching of satellites was enabled by developments in ballistic missile capabilities since the end of World War II. The competition gained Western public attention with the \"Sputnik crisis\", when the USSR achieved the first successful satellite launch, Sputnik 1, on October 4, 1957. It gained momentum when the USSR sent the first human, Yuri Gagarin, into space with the orbital flight of Vostok 1 on April 12, 1961. These were followed by a string of other firsts achieved by the Soviets over the next few years.\nGagarin's flight led US president John F. Kennedy to raise the stakes on May 25, 1961, by asking the US Congress to commit to the goal of \"landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth\" before the end of the decade. Both countries began developing super heavy-lift launch vehicles, with the US successfully deploying the Saturn V, which was large enough to send a three-person orbiter and two-person lander to the Moon. Kennedy's Moon landing goal was achieved in July 1969, with the flight of Apollo 11. The USSR continued to pursue crewed lunar programs to launch and land on the Moon before the US with its N1 rocket but did not succeed, and eventually canceled it to concentrate on Salyut, the first space station program, and the first landings on Venus and on Mars. Meanwhile, the US landed five more Apollo crews on the Moon, and continued exploration of other extraterrestrial bodies robotically.\nA period of détente followed with the April 1972 agreement on a cooperative Apollo–Soyuz Test Project (ASTP), resulting in the July 1975 rendezvous in Earth orbit of a US astronaut crew with a Soviet cosmonaut crew and joint development of an international docking standard APAS-75. Being considered as the final act of the Space Race by many observers, the competition was however only gradually replaced with cooperation. The collapse of the Soviet Union eventually allowed the US and the newly reconstituted Russian Federation to end their Cold War competition also in space, by agreeing in 1993 on the Shuttle–Mir and International Space Station programs.",

      "title": "Neptune",
      "content": "Neptune is the eighth and farthest known planet orbiting the Sun. It is the fourth-largest planet in the Solar System by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet. It is 17 times the mass of Earth. Compared to Uranus, its neighbouring ice giant, Neptune is slightly smaller, but more massive and denser. Being composed primarily of gases and liquids, it has no well-defined solid surface. Neptune orbits the Sun once every 164.8 years at an orbital distance of 30.1 astronomical units (4.5 billion kilometres; 2.8 billion miles). It is named after the Roman god of the sea and has the astronomical symbol , representing Neptune's trident.\nNeptune is not visible to the unaided eye and is the only planet in the Solar System that was not initially observed by direct empirical observation. Rather, unexpected changes in the orbit of Uranus led Alexis Bouvard to hypothesise that its orbit was subject to gravitational perturbation by an unknown planet. After Bouvard's death, the position of Neptune was mathematically predicted from his observations, independently, by John Couch Adams and Urbain Le Verrier. Neptune was subsequently directly observed with a telescope on 23 September 1846 by Johann Gottfried Galle within a degree of the position predicted by Le Verrier. Its largest moon, Triton, was discovered shortly thereafter, though none of the planet's remaining moons were located telescopically until the 20th century.\nThe planet's distance from Earth gives it a small apparent size, and its distance from the Sun renders it very dim, making it challenging to study with Earth-based telescopes. Only the advent of the Hubble Space Telescope and of large ground-based telescopes with adaptive optics allowed for detailed observations. Neptune was visited by Voyager 2, which flew by the planet on 25 August 1989; Voyager 2 remains the only spacecraft to have visited it. Like the gas giants (Jupiter and Saturn), Neptune's atmosphere is composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, along with traces of hydrocarbons and possibly nitrogen, but contains a higher proportion of ices such as water, ammonia and methane. Similar to Uranus, its interior is primarily composed of ices and rock; both planets are normally considered \"ice giants\" to distinguish them. Along with Rayleigh scattering, traces of methane in the outermost regions make Neptune appear faintly blue.\nIn contrast to the strongly seasonal atmosphere of Uranus, which can be featureless for long periods of time, Neptune's atmosphere has active and consistently visible weather patterns. At the time of the Voyager 2 flyby in 1989, the planet's southern hemisphere had a Great Dark Spot comparable to the Great Red Spot on Jupiter. In 2018, a newer main dark spot and smaller dark spot were identified and studied. These weather patterns are driven by the strongest sustained winds of any planet in the Solar System, as high as 2,100 km/h (580 m/s; 1,300 mph). Because of its great distance from the Sun, Neptune's outer atmosphere is one of the coldest places in the Solar System, with temperatures at its cloud tops approaching 55 K (−218 °C; −361 °F). Temperatures at the planet's centre are approximately 5,400 K (5,100 °C; 9,300 °F). Neptune has a faint and fragmented ring system (labelled \"arcs\"), discovered in 1984 and confirmed by Voyager 2.",

      "title": "Impact crater",
      "content": "An impact crater is a depression in the surface of a solid astronomical body formed by the hypervelocity impact of a smaller object. In contrast to volcanic craters, which result from explosion or internal collapse, impact craters typically have raised rims and floors that are lower in elevation than the surrounding terrain. Impact craters are typically circular, though they can be elliptical in shape or even irregular due to events such as landslides. Impact craters range in size from microscopic craters seen on lunar rocks returned by the Apollo Program to  simple bowl-shaped depressions and vast, complex, multi-ringed impact basins. Meteor Crater is a well-known example of a small impact crater on Earth.\nImpact craters are the dominant geographic features on many solid Solar System objects including the Moon, Mercury, Callisto, Ganymede, and most small moons and asteroids. On other planets and moons that experience more active surface geological processes, such as Earth, Venus, Europa, Io, Titan, and Triton, visible impact craters are less common because they become eroded, buried, or transformed by tectonic and volcanic processes over time. Where such processes have destroyed most of the original crater topography, the terms impact structure or astrobleme are more commonly used. In early literature, before the significance of impact cratering was widely recognised, the terms cryptoexplosion or cryptovolcanic structure were often used to describe what are now recognised as impact-related features on Earth.\nThe cratering records of very old surfaces, such as Mercury, the Moon, and the southern highlands of Mars, record a period of intense early bombardment in the inner Solar System around 3.9 billion years ago. The rate of crater production on Earth has since been considerably lower, but it is appreciable nonetheless. Earth experiences, on average, from one to three impacts large enough to produce a 20-kilometre-diameter (12 mi) crater every million years. This indicates that there should be far more relatively young craters on the planet than have been discovered so far. The cratering rate in the inner solar system fluctuates as a consequence of collisions in the asteroid belt that create a family of fragments that are often sent cascading into the inner solar system. Formed in a collision 80 million years ago, the Baptistina family of asteroids is thought to have caused a large spike in the impact rate. The rate of impact cratering in the outer Solar System could be different from the inner Solar System.\nAlthough Earth's active surface processes quickly destroy the impact record, about 190 terrestrial impact craters have been identified. These range in diameter from a few tens of meters up to about 300 km (190 mi), and they range in age from recent times (e.g. the Sikhote-Alin craters in Russia whose creation was witnessed in 1947) to more than two billion years, though most are less than 500 million years old because geological processes tend to obliterate older craters. They are also selectively found in the stable interior regions of continents. Few undersea craters have been discovered because of the difficulty of surveying the sea floor, the rapid rate of change of the ocean bottom, and the subduction of the ocean floor into Earth's interior by processes of plate tectonics.",

      "content": "Zenzile Miriam Makeba ( mə-KAY-bə, Xhosa: [máˈkʼêːɓà̤] ; 4 March 1932 – 9 November 2008), nicknamed Mama Africa, was a South African singer, songwriter, actress, and civil rights activist. Associated with musical genres including Afropop, jazz, and world music, she was an advocate against apartheid and white-minority government in South Africa.\nBorn in Johannesburg to Swazi and Xhosa parents, Makeba was forced to find employment as a child after the death of her father. She had a brief and allegedly abusive first marriage at the age of 17, gave birth to her only child in 1950, and survived breast cancer. Her vocal talent had been recognized when she was a child, and she began singing professionally in the 1950s, with the Cuban Brothers, the Manhattan Brothers, and an all-woman group, the Skylarks, performing a mixture of jazz, traditional African melodies, and Western popular music. In 1959, Makeba had a brief role in the anti-apartheid film Come Back, Africa, which brought her international attention, and led to her performing in Venice, London, and New York City. In London, she met the American singer Harry Belafonte, who became a mentor and colleague. She moved to New York City, where she became immediately popular, and recorded her first solo album in 1960. Her attempt to return to South Africa that year for her mother's funeral was prevented by the country's government.\nMakeba's career flourished in the United States, and she released several albums and songs, her most popular being \"Pata Pata\" (1967). Along with Belafonte, she received a Grammy Award for Best Folk Recording for their 1965 album An Evening with Belafonte/Makeba. She testified against the South African government at the United Nations and became involved in the civil rights movement. She married Stokely Carmichael, a leader of the Black Panther Party, in 1968, and consequently lost support among white Americans.  Her visa was revoked by the US government when she was traveling abroad, forcing her and Carmichael to relocate to Guinea. She continued to perform, mostly in African countries, including at several independence celebrations. She began to write and perform music more explicitly critical of apartheid; the 1977 song \"Soweto Blues\", written by her former husband Hugh Masekela, was about the Soweto uprising. After apartheid was dismantled in 1990, Makeba returned to South Africa. She continued recording and performing, including a 1991 album with Nina Simone and Dizzy Gillespie, and appeared in the 1992 film Sarafina!. She was named an FAO Goodwill Ambassador in 1999, and campaigned for humanitarian causes. She died of a heart attack during a 2008 concert in Italy.\nMakeba was among the first African musicians to receive worldwide recognition. She brought African music to a Western audience, and popularized the world music and Afropop genres. Despite her cosmopolitan background, she was frequently viewed by Western audiences as an embodiment of Africa: she was also seen as a style icon in both South Africa and the West. Makeba made popular several songs critical of apartheid, and became a symbol of opposition to the system, particularly after her right to return was revoked. Upon her death, former South African President Nelson Mandela said that \"her music inspired a powerful sense of hope in all of us.\"",

      "title": "Physics of magnetic resonance imaging",
      "content": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a medical imaging technique mostly used in radiology and nuclear medicine in order to investigate the anatomy and physiology of the body, and to detect pathologies including tumors, inflammation, neurological conditions such as stroke, disorders of muscles and joints, and abnormalities in the heart and blood vessels among other things. Contrast agents may be injected intravenously or into a joint to enhance the image and facilitate diagnosis. Unlike CT and X-ray, MRI uses no ionizing radiation and is, therefore, a safe procedure suitable for diagnosis in children and repeated runs. Patients with specific non-ferromagnetic metal implants, cochlear implants, and cardiac pacemakers nowadays may also have an MRI in spite of effects of the strong magnetic fields. This does not apply on older devices, and details for medical professionals are provided by the device's manufacturer.\nCertain atomic nuclei are able to absorb and emit radio frequency energy when placed in an external magnetic field. In clinical and research MRI, hydrogen atoms are most often used to generate a detectable radio-frequency signal that is received by antennas close to the anatomy being examined. Hydrogen atoms are naturally abundant in people and other biological organisms, particularly in water and fat. For this reason, most MRI scans essentially map the location of water and fat in the body. Pulses of radio waves excite the nuclear spin energy transition, and magnetic field gradients localize the signal in space. By varying the parameters of the pulse sequence, different contrasts may be generated between tissues based on the relaxation properties of the hydrogen atoms therein.\nWhen inside the magnetic field (B0) of the scanner, the magnetic moments of the protons align to be either parallel or anti-parallel to the direction of the field. While each individual proton can only have one of two alignments, the collection of protons appear to behave as though they can have any alignment. Most protons align parallel to B0 as this is a lower energy state. A radio frequency pulse is then applied, which can excite protons from parallel to anti-parallel alignment; only the latter are relevant to the rest of the discussion. In response to the force bringing them back to their equilibrium orientation, the protons undergo a rotating motion (precession), much like a spun wheel under the effect of gravity. The protons will return to the low energy state by the process of spin-lattice relaxation. This appears as a magnetic flux, which yields a changing voltage in the receiver coils to give a signal. The frequency at which a proton or group of protons in a voxel resonates depends on the strength of the local magnetic field around the proton or group of protons, a stronger field corresponds to a larger energy difference and higher frequency photons. By applying additional magnetic fields (gradients) that vary linearly over space, specific slices to be imaged can be selected, and an image is obtained by taking the 2-D Fourier transform of the spatial frequencies of the signal (k-space). Due to the magnetic Lorentz force from B0 on the current flowing in the gradient coils, the gradient coils will try to move producing loud knocking sounds, for which patients require hearing protection.",

      "content": "The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite. It orbits around Earth at an average distance of 384399 km (238854 mi; about 30 times Earth's diameter). Its orbital period (lunar month) and its rotation period (lunar day) are synchronized at 29.5 days by Earth's gravity pulling on the Moon. This makes the Moon tidally locked to Earth, always facing it with the same side. The Moon's gravitational pull produces tidal forces on Earth, which are the main driver of Earth's tides.\nIn geophysical terms, the Moon is a planetary-mass object or satellite planet. Its mass is 1.2% that of the Earth, and its diameter is 3,474 km (2,159 mi), roughly one-quarter of Earth's (about as wide as the contiguous United States). Within the Solar System, it is the largest and most massive satellite in relation to its parent planet. It is the fifth-largest and fifth-most massive moon overall, and is larger and more massive than all known dwarf planets. Its surface gravity is about one-sixth of Earth's, about half that of Mars, and the second-highest among all moons in the Solar System after Jupiter's moon Io. The body of the Moon is differentiated and terrestrial, with no significant hydrosphere, atmosphere, or magnetic field. The lunar surface is covered in lunar dust and marked by mountains, impact craters, their ejecta, ray-like streaks, rilles and, mostly on the near side of the Moon, by dark maria ('seas'), which are plains of cooled lava. These maria are believed to have formed when molten lava flowed into ancient impact basins. The Moon was formed 4.51 billion years ago, not long after Earth's formation, out of the debris from a giant impact between Earth and a hypothesized Mars-sized body known as Theia.\nFrom a distance, the day and night phases of the lunar day are visible as the lunar phases, and when the Moon passes through Earth's shadow a lunar eclipse is observable. The Moon's apparent size in Earth's sky is about the same as that of the Sun, which causes it to cover the Sun completely during a total solar eclipse. The Moon is the brightest celestial object in Earth's night sky because of its large apparent size, while the reflectance (albedo) of its surface is comparable to that of asphalt. About 59% of the surface of the Moon is visible from Earth, owing to the different angles at which the Moon can appear in Earth's sky (libration), making parts of the far side of the Moon visible.\nThe Moon has been an important source of inspiration and knowledge in human history, having been crucial to cosmography, mythology, religion, art, time keeping, natural science, and spaceflight. The first human-made objects to fly to an extraterrestrial body were sent to the Moon starting in 1959 with the flyby of the Soviet Union's Luna 1 and the intentional impact of Luna 2. In 1966, the first soft landing (by Luna 9) and orbital insertion (by Luna 10) followed. On July 20, 1969, during the United State's Apollo 11 mission, humans stepped on to an extraterrestrial body for the first time at Mare Tranquillitatis in the lander Eagle. Five more crews were sent between 1970 and 1972, each landing two men on the Moon's surface. The longest stay was 75 hours by the Apollo 17 crew, after which exploration of the Moon was continued using robots. Crewed missions were planned to return in the late 2020s.",

      "title": "Plutonium",
      "content": "Plutonium is a chemical element; it has symbol Pu and atomic number 94.  It was initially discovered and named Hesperium by Enrico Fermi in 1934. It is a silvery-gray actinide metal that tarnishes when exposed to air, and forms a dull coating when oxidized. The element normally exhibits six allotropes and four oxidation states. It reacts with carbon, halogens, nitrogen, silicon, and hydrogen. When exposed to moist air, it forms oxides and hydrides that can expand the sample up to 70% in volume, which in turn flake off as a powder that is pyrophoric. It is radioactive and can accumulate in bones, which makes the handling of plutonium dangerous.\nPlutonium was first synthesized and isolated in late 1940 and early 1941, by deuteron bombardment of uranium-238 in the 1.5-metre (60 in) cyclotron at the University of California, Berkeley. First, neptunium-238 (half-life 2.1 days) was synthesized, which then beta-decayed to form the new element with atomic number 94 and atomic weight 238 (half-life 88 years). Since uranium had been named after the planet Uranus and neptunium after the planet Neptune, element 94 was named after Pluto, which at the time was also considered a planet. Wartime secrecy prevented the University of California team from publishing its discovery until 1948.\nPlutonium is the element with the highest atomic number known to occur in nature. Trace quantities arise in natural uranium deposits when uranium-238 captures neutrons emitted by decay of other uranium-238 atoms. The heavy isotope plutonium-244 has a half-life long enough that extreme trace quantities should have survived primordially (from the Earth's formation) to the present, but so far experiments have not yet been sensitive enough to detect it.\nBoth plutonium-239 and plutonium-241 are fissile, meaning they can sustain a nuclear chain reaction, leading to applications in nuclear weapons and nuclear reactors. Plutonium-240 has a high rate of spontaneous fission, raising the neutron flux of any sample containing it. The presence of plutonium-240 limits a plutonium sample's usability for weapons or its quality as reactor fuel, and the percentage of plutonium-240 determines its grade (weapons-grade, fuel-grade, or reactor-grade). Plutonium-238 has a half-life of 87.7 years and emits alpha particles. It is a heat source in radioisotope thermoelectric generators, which are used to power some spacecraft. Plutonium isotopes are expensive and inconvenient to separate, so particular isotopes are usually manufactured in specialized reactors.\nProducing plutonium in useful quantities for the first time was a major part of the Manhattan Project during World War II that developed the first atomic bombs. The Fat Man bombs used in the Trinity nuclear test in July 1945, and in the bombing of Nagasaki in August 1945, had plutonium cores. Human radiation experiments studying plutonium were conducted without informed consent, and several criticality accidents, some lethal, occurred after the war. Disposal of plutonium waste from nuclear power plants and dismantled nuclear weapons built during the Cold War is a nuclear-proliferation and environmental concern. Other sources of plutonium in the environment are fallout from many above-ground nuclear tests, which are now banned.",

      "title": "Outer Space Treaty",
      "content": "The Outer Space Treaty, formally the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies, is a multilateral treaty that forms the basis of international space law. Negotiated and drafted under the auspices of the United Nations, it was opened for signature in the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union on 27 January 1967, entering into force on 10 October 1967. As of May 2025, 117 countries are parties to the treaty—including all major spacefaring nations—and another 22 are signatories.\nThe Outer Space Treaty was spurred by the development of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) in the 1950s, which could reach targets through outer space. The Soviet Union's launch of Sputnik, the first artificial satellite, in October 1957, followed by a subsequent arms race with the United States, hastened proposals to prohibit the use of outer space for military purposes. On 17 October 1963, the U.N. General Assembly unanimously adopted a resolution prohibiting the introduction of weapons of mass destruction in outer space. Various proposals for an arms control treaty governing outer space were debated during a General Assembly session in December 1966, culminating in the drafting and adoption of the Outer Space Treaty the following January.\nKey provisions of the Outer Space Treaty include prohibiting nuclear weapons in space; limiting the use of the Moon and all other celestial bodies to peaceful purposes; establishing that space shall be freely explored and used by all nations; and precluding any country from claiming sovereignty over outer space or any celestial body. Although it forbids establishing military bases, testing weapons and conducting military maneuvers on celestial bodies, the treaty does not expressly ban all military activities in space, nor the establishment of military space forces or the placement of conventional weapons in space. \nFrom 1968 to 1984, the OST gave birth to four additional agreements: rules for activities on the Moon; liability for damages caused by spacecraft; the safe return of fallen astronauts; and the registration of space vehicles.\nOST provided many practical uses and was the most important link in the chain of international legal arrangements for space from the late 1950s to the mid-1980s. OST was at the heart of a 'network' of inter-state treaties and strategic power negotiations to achieve the best available conditions for nuclear weapons world security. The OST also declares that space is an area for free use and exploration by all and \"shall be the province of all mankind\". Drawing heavily from the Antarctic Treaty of 1961, the Outer Space Treaty likewise focuses on regulating certain activities and preventing unrestricted competition that could lead to conflict. Consequently, it is largely silent or ambiguous on newly developed space activities such as lunar and asteroid mining. Nevertheless, the Outer Space Treaty is the first and most foundational legal instrument of space law, and its broader principles of promoting the civil and peaceful use of space continue to underpin multilateral initiatives in space, such as the International Space Station and the Artemis Program.",

      "title": "Space colonization",
      "content": "Space colonization (or extraterrestrial colonization) is the settlement or colonization of outer space and astronomical bodies. The concept in its broad sense has been applied to any permanent human presence in space, such as a space habitat or other extraterrestrial settlements. It may involve a process of occupation or control for exploitation, such as extraterrestrial mining.\nMaking territorial claims in space is prohibited by international space law, defining space as a common heritage. International space law has had the goal to prevent colonial claims and militarization of space, and has advocated the installation of international regimes to regulate access to and sharing of space, particularly for specific locations such as the limited space of geostationary orbit or the Moon. To date, no permanent space settlement other than temporary space habitats have been established, nor has any extraterrestrial territory or land been internationally claimed. Currently there are also no plans for building a space colony by any government. However, many proposals, speculations, and designs, particularly for extraterrestrial settlements have been made through the years, and a considerable number of space colonization advocates and groups are active. Currently, the dominant private launch provider SpaceX, has been the most prominent organization planning space colonization on Mars, though having not reached a development stage beyond launch and landing systems.\nSpace colonization raises numerous socio-political questions. Many arguments for and against space settlement have been made. The two most common reasons in favor of colonization are the survival of humans and life independent of Earth, making humans a multiplanetary species, in the event of a planetary-scale disaster (natural or human-made), and the commercial use of space particularly for enabling a more sustainable expansion of human society through the availability of additional resources in space, reducing environmental damage on and exploitation of Earth. The most common objections include concerns that the commodification of the cosmos may be likely to continue pre-existing detrimental processes such as environmental degradation, economic inequality and wars, enhancing the interests of the already powerful, and at the cost of investing in solving existing major environmental and social issues.\nThe mere construction of an extraterrestrial settlement, with the needed infrastructure, presents daunting technological, economic and social challenges. Space settlements are generally conceived as providing for nearly all (or all) the needs of larger numbers of humans. The environment in space is very hostile to human life and not readily accessible, particularly for maintenance and supply. It would involve much advancement of currently primitive technologies, such as controlled ecological life-support systems. With the high cost of orbital spaceflight (around $1400 per kg, or $640 per pound, to low Earth orbit by SpaceX Falcon Heavy), a space settlement would currently be massively expensive, but ongoing progress in reusable launch systems aim to change that (possibly reaching $20 per kg to orbit), and in creating automated manufacturing and construction techniques.",

      "title": "Habitable zone",
      "content": "In astronomy and astrobiology, the habitable zone (HZ), or more precisely the circumstellar habitable zone (CHZ), is the range of orbits around a star within which a planetary surface can support liquid water given sufficient atmospheric pressure. The bounds of the HZ are based on Earth's position in the Solar System and the amount of radiant energy it receives from the Sun. Due to the importance of liquid water to Earth's biosphere, the nature of the HZ and the objects within it may be instrumental in determining the scope and distribution of planets capable of supporting Earth-like extraterrestrial life and intelligence. As such, it is considered by many to be a major factor of planetary habitability, and the most likely place to find extraterrestrial liquid water and biosignatures elsewhere in the universe.\nThe habitable zone is also called the Goldilocks zone, a metaphor, allusion and antonomasia of the children's fairy tale of \"Goldilocks and the Three Bears\", in which a little girl chooses from sets of three items, rejecting the ones that are too extreme (large or small, hot or cold, etc.), and settling on the one in the middle, which is \"just right\".\nSince the concept was first presented many stars have been confirmed to possess an HZ planet, including some systems that consist of multiple HZ planets. Most such planets, being either super-Earths or gas giants, are more massive than Earth, because massive planets are easier to detect. On November 4, 2013, astronomers reported, based on Kepler space telescope data, that there could be as many as 40 billion Earth-sized planets orbiting in the habitable zones of Sun-like stars and red dwarfs in the Milky Way. About 11 billion of these may be orbiting Sun-like stars. Proxima Centauri b, located about 4.2 light-years (1.3 parsecs) from Earth in the constellation of Centaurus, is the nearest known exoplanet, and is orbiting in the habitable zone of its star. The HZ is also of particular interest to the emerging field of habitability of natural satellites because planetary mass moons in the HZ might outnumber planets.\nIn subsequent decades, the HZ concept began to be challenged as a primary criterion for life, so the concept is still evolving.  Since the discovery of evidence for extraterrestrial liquid water, substantial quantities of it are now thought to occur outside the circumstellar habitable zone. The concept of deep biospheres, like Earth's, that exist independently of stellar energy, are now generally accepted in astrobiology given the large amount of liquid water known to exist in lithospheres and asthenospheres of the Solar System. Sustained by other energy sources, such as tidal heating or radioactive decay or pressurized by non-atmospheric means, liquid water may be found even on rogue planets, or their moons. Liquid water can also exist at a wider range of temperatures and pressures as a solution, for example with sodium chlorides in seawater on Earth, chlorides and sulphates on equatorial Mars, or ammoniates, due to its different colligative properties. In addition, other circumstellar zones, where non-water solvents favorable to hypothetical life based on alternative biochemistries could exist in liquid form at the surface, have been proposed.",

      "content": "Starship flight test 1 was the maiden flight of the integrated SpaceX Starship launch vehicle. SpaceX performed the flight test on April 20, 2023. The prototype vehicle was destroyed less than four minutes after lifting off from the SpaceX Starbase in Boca Chica, Texas. The vehicle became the most powerful rocket ever flown, breaking the half-century-old record held by the Soviet Union's N1 rocket. The launch was the first \"integrated flight test,\" meaning it was the first time that the Super Heavy booster and the Starship spacecraft flew together as a fully integrated Starship launch vehicle.\nThe launch was part of SpaceX's Starship development program, which follows an iterative and incremental approach involving frequent, and often destructive, test flights of prototype vehicles. Before the launch, SpaceX officials said they would measure the mission's success \"by how much we can learn\" and that various planned mission events \"are not required for a successful test\". The flight was generally regarded as having furthered Starship's development, and a variety of public officials congratulated SpaceX, including NASA administrator Bill Nelson and European Space Agency Director General Josef Aschbacher.\nIt was planned for the Starship spacecraft to complete nearly one orbit around the Earth before reentering the atmosphere, performing a controlled descent and splashing down in the Pacific Ocean near Hawaii. The Super Heavy booster was to have performed a similar landing in the Gulf of Mexico, about 20 mi (30 km) off the Texas coast about 8 minutes after liftoff.\nThe rocket lifted off at 13:33 UTC (8:33 am CDT, local time at the launch site) from SpaceX's private launch site near Boca Chica, Texas. The liftoff damaged the launch pad and its surrounding infrastructure, which SpaceX said was unexpected. Some debris spread into Boca Chica State Park. Three engines did not start or aborted before liftoff, and several others failed during the flight. The vehicle passed max q and entered supersonic flight, but, due to a lack of thrust or thrust vector control, no attempt was made at stage separation. After Starship began to lose altitude and tumble, the autonomous flight termination system (AFTS) on the vehicle activated, which took 40 seconds to destroy the vehicle, nearly 4 minutes into the flight.\nAfter the test, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) grounded the launch program pending results of a standard “mishap investigation” overseen by the agency and performed by SpaceX. The FAA said that a return to flight would depend on the agency's determination that future launches would not affect public safety. In August 2023, SpaceX submitted to the FAA the 63 \"corrective actions\" that it would need to take before another Starship launch would be allowed. Dust scattered by the launch initially caused some health concerns, but was later found by a laboratory to be ordinary beach sand, not posing a health hazard.\nA second flight test of the Starship vehicle occurred on November 18, 2023, seven months after its maiden flight. The launch did not repeat issues encountered on the first flight; the vehicle successfully performed stage separation using a new method, but both vehicles were lost thereafter.",

      "content": "Marseille (French: Marseille; Provençal Occitan: Marselha; see below) is a city in southern France, the prefecture of the department of Bouches-du-Rhône and of the Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur region. Situated in the Provence region, it is located on the coast of the Mediterranean Sea, near the mouth of the Rhône river. Marseille is the second-most populous city proper in France, after Paris, with 877,215 inhabitants in 2022 (Jan. census) over a municipal territory of 241 km2 (93 sq mi). Together with its suburbs and exurbs, the Marseille metropolitan area, which extends over 3,972 km2 (1,534 sq mi), had a population of 1,900,957 at the Jan. 2022 census, the third most populated in France after those of Paris and Lyon. The cities of Marseille, Aix-en-Provence, and 90 suburban municipalities have formed since 2016 the Aix-Marseille-Provence Metropolis, an indirectly elected metropolitan authority now in charge of wider metropolitan issues, with a population of 1,922,626 at the Jan. 2022 census.\nFounded c. 600 BC by Greek settlers from Phocaea, Marseille is the oldest city in France, as well as one of Europe's oldest continuously inhabited settlements. It was known to the ancient Greeks as Massalia and to Romans as Massilia. Marseille has been a trading port since ancient times. In particular, it experienced a considerable commercial boom during the colonial period and especially during the 19th century, becoming a prosperous industrial and trading city. Nowadays the Old Port still lies at the heart of the city, where the manufacture of Marseille soap began some six centuries ago. Overlooking the port is the Basilica of Notre-Dame-de-la-Garde or \"Bonne-mère\" for the people of Marseille, a Romano-Byzantine church and the symbol of the city. Inherited from this past, the Grand Port Maritime de Marseille (GPMM) and the maritime economy are major poles of regional and national activity and Marseille remains the first French port, the second Mediterranean port and the fifth European port. Since its origins, Marseille's openness to the Mediterranean Sea has made it a cosmopolitan city marked by cultural and economic exchanges with Southern Europe, the Middle East, North Africa and Asia. In Europe, the city has the third largest Jewish community after London and Paris.\nIn the 1990s, the Euroméditerranée project for economic development and urban renewal was launched. New infrastructure projects and renovations were carried out in the 2000s and 2010s: the tramway, the renovation of the Hôtel-Dieu into a luxury hotel, the expansion of the Velodrome Stadium, the CMA CGM Tower, as well as other quayside museums such as the Museum of Civilisations of Europe and the Mediterranean (MuCEM). As a result, Marseille now has the most museums in France after Paris. The city was named European Capital of Culture in 2013 and European Capital of Sport in 2017. Home of the association football club Olympique de Marseille, one of the most successful and widely supported clubs in France, Marseille has also hosted matches at the 1998 World Cup and Euro 2016. It is also home to several higher education institutions in the region, including the University of Aix-Marseille. A resident of Marseille is a Marseillais.",

      "content": "The moons of Saturn are numerous and diverse, ranging from tiny moonlets only tens of meters across to the much larger Titan, which is larger than the planet Mercury. As of 11 March 2025, there are 274 moons with confirmed orbits, the most of any planet in the Solar System. Three of these are particularly notable. Titan is the second-largest moon in the Solar System (after Jupiter's Ganymede), with a nitrogen-rich Earth-like atmosphere and a landscape featuring river networks and hydrocarbon lakes. Enceladus emits jets of ice from its south-polar region and is covered in a deep layer of snow. Iapetus has contrasting black and white hemispheres as well as an extensive ridge of equatorial mountains among the tallest in the solar system.\nTwenty-four of the known moons are regular satellites; they have prograde orbits not greatly inclined to Saturn's equatorial plane (except Iapetus, which has a prograde but highly inclined orbit). They include the seven major satellites, four small moons that exist in a trojan orbit with larger moons, and five that act as shepherd moons, of which two are mutually co-orbital. Two tiny moons orbit inside of Saturn's B and G rings. The relatively large Hyperion is locked in an orbital resonance with Titan. The remaining regular moons orbit near the outer edges of the dense A Ring and the narrow F Ring, and between the major moons Mimas and Enceladus. The regular satellites are traditionally named after Titans and Titanesses or other figures associated with the mythological Saturn.\nThe remaining 250, with mean diameters ranging from 2 to 213 km (1 to 132 mi), orbit much farther from Saturn. They are irregular satellites, having high orbital inclinations and eccentricities mixed between prograde and retrograde. These moons are probably captured minor planets, or fragments from the collisional breakup of such bodies after they were captured, creating collisional families. The irregular satellites are classified by their orbital characteristics into the prograde Inuit and Gallic groups and the large retrograde Norse group, and their names are chosen from the corresponding mythologies (with the Gallic group corresponding to Celtic mythology). As of March 2025, 210 of these are unnamed (plus the designated B-ring moonlet S/2009 S 1). Phoebe, the largest irregular Saturnian moon, is the sole exception to this naming system; it is part of the Norse group but named for a Greek Titaness.\nThe rings of Saturn are made up of objects ranging in size from microscopic to moonlets hundreds of meters across, each in its own orbit around Saturn. The number of moons given above does not include these moonlets, nor hundreds of possible kilometer-sized distant moons that have been observed on single occasions. Thus an absolute number of Saturnian moons cannot be given, because there is no consensus on a boundary between the countless small unnamed objects that form Saturn's ring system and the larger objects that have been named as moons. Over 150 moonlets embedded in the rings have been detected by the disturbance they create in the surrounding ring material, though this is thought to be only a small sample of the total population of such objects.",

      "content": "Cassini–Huygens ( kə-SEE-nee HOY-gənz), commonly called Cassini, was a space-research mission by NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA), and the Italian Space Agency (ASI) to send a space probe to study the planet Saturn and its system, including its rings and natural satellites. The Flagship-class robotic spacecraft comprised both NASA's Cassini space probe and ESA's Huygens lander, which landed on Saturn's largest moon, Titan. Cassini was the fourth space probe to visit Saturn and the first to enter its orbit, where it stayed from 2004 to 2017. The two craft took their names from the astronomers Giovanni Cassini and Christiaan Huygens.\nLaunched aboard a Titan IVB/Centaur on October 15, 1997, Cassini was active in space for nearly 20 years, spending its final 13 years orbiting Saturn and studying the planet and its system after entering orbit on July 1, 2004.\nThe voyage to Saturn included flybys of Venus (April 1998 and July 1999), Earth (August 1999), the asteroid 2685 Masursky, and Jupiter (December 2000). The mission ended on September 15, 2017, when Cassini's trajectory took it into Saturn's upper atmosphere and it burned up in order to prevent any risk of contaminating Saturn's moons, which might have offered habitable environments to stowaway terrestrial microbes on the spacecraft. The mission was successful beyond expectations – NASA's Planetary Science Division Director, Jim Green, described Cassini-Huygens as a \"mission of firsts\" that has revolutionized human understanding of the Saturn system, including its moons and rings, and our understanding of where life might be found in the Solar System.\nCassini's planners originally scheduled a mission of four years, from June 2004 to May 2008. The mission was extended for another two years until September 2010, branded the Cassini Equinox Mission. The mission was extended a second and final time with the Cassini Solstice Mission, lasting another seven years until September 15, 2017, on which date Cassini was de-orbited to burn up in Saturn's upper atmosphere.\nThe Huygens module traveled with Cassini until its separation from the probe on December 25, 2004; Huygens landed by parachute on Titan on January 14, 2005. The separation was facilitated by the SED (Spin/Eject device), which provided a relative separation speed of 0.35 metres per second (1.1 ft/s) and a spin rate of 7.5 rpm. It returned data to Earth for around 90 minutes, using the orbiter as a relay. This was the first landing ever accomplished in the outer Solar System and the first landing on a moon other than Earth's Moon.\nAt the end of its mission, the Cassini spacecraft executed its \"Grand Finale\": a number of risky passes through the gaps between Saturn and its inner rings.\nThis phase aimed to maximize Cassini's scientific outcome before the spacecraft was intentionally destroyed to prevent potential contamination of Saturn's moons if Cassini were to unintentionally crash into them when maneuvering the probe was no longer possible due to power loss or other communication issues at the end of its operational lifespan. The atmospheric entry of Cassini ended the mission, but analysis of the returned data will continue for many years.",

      "content": "An engineering technologist is a professional trained in certain aspects of development and implementation of a respective area of technology. An education in engineering technology concentrates more on application and less on theory than does an engineering education. Engineering technologists often assist engineers; but after years of experience, they can also become engineers. Like engineers, areas where engineering technologists can work include product design, fabrication, and testing. Engineering technologists sometimes rise to senior management positions in industry or become entrepreneurs.\nEngineering technologists are more likely than engineers to focus on post-development implementation, product manufacturing, or operation of technology. The American National Society of Professional Engineers (NSPE) makes the distinction that engineers are trained in conceptual skills, to \"function as designers\", while engineering technologists \"apply others' designs\". The mathematics and sciences, as well as other technical courses, in engineering technology programs, are taught with more application-based examples, whereas engineering coursework provides a more theoretical foundation in math and science. Moreover, engineering coursework tends to require higher-level mathematics including calculus and calculus-based theoretical science courses, as well as more extensive knowledge of the natural sciences, which serves to prepare students for research (whether in graduate studies or industrial R&D) as opposed to engineering technology coursework which focuses on algebra, trigonometry, applied calculus, and other courses that are more practical than theoretical in nature and generally have more labs that involve the hands-on application of the topics studied.\nIn the United States, although some states require, without exception, a BS degree in engineering at schools with programs accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission (EAC) of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET), about two-thirds of the states accept BS degrees in engineering technology accredited by the Engineering Technology Accreditation Commission (ETAC) of the ABET, in order to become licensed as professional engineers. States have different requirements as to the years of experience needed to take the Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) and Professional Engineering (PE) exams. A few states require those sitting for the exams to have a master's degree in engineering. This education model is in line with the educational system in the United Kingdom where an accredited MEng or MSc degree in engineering is required by the Engineering Council (EngC) to be registered as a Chartered Engineer. Engineering technology graduates with can earn an MS degree in engineering technology, engineering, engineering management, construction management, or a National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB)-accredited Master of Architecture degree. These degrees are also offered online or through distance-learning programs at various universities, both nationally and internationally, which allows individuals to continue working full-time while earning an advanced degree.",

      "content": "Neil Alden Armstrong (August 5, 1930 – August 25, 2012) was an American astronaut and aeronautical engineer who, as the commander of the 1969 Apollo 11 mission, became the first person to walk on the Moon. He was also a naval aviator, test pilot and university professor.\nArmstrong was born and raised near Wapakoneta, Ohio. He entered Purdue University, studying aeronautical engineering, with the United States Navy paying his tuition under the Holloway Plan.  He became a midshipman in 1949 and a naval aviator the following year. He saw action in the Korean War, flying the Grumman F9F Panther from the aircraft carrier USS Essex. After the war, he completed his bachelor's degree at Purdue and became a test pilot at the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) High-Speed Flight Station at Edwards Air Force Base in California. He was the project pilot on Century Series fighters and flew the North American X-15 seven times. He was also a participant in the U.S. Air Force's Man in Space Soonest and X-20 Dyna-Soar human spaceflight programs.\nArmstrong joined the NASA Astronaut Corps in the second group, which was selected in 1962. He made his first spaceflight as command pilot of Gemini 8 in March 1966, becoming NASA's first civilian astronaut to fly in space. During this mission with pilot David Scott, he performed the first docking of two spacecraft; the mission was aborted after Armstrong used some of his re-entry control fuel to stabilize a dangerous roll caused by a stuck thruster. During training for Armstrong's second and last spaceflight as commander of Apollo 11, he had to eject from the Lunar Landing Research Vehicle moments before a crash.\nOn July 20, 1969, Armstrong and Apollo 11 Lunar Module (LM) pilot Buzz Aldrin became the first people to land on the Moon, and the next day they spent two and a half hours outside the Lunar Module Eagle spacecraft while Michael Collins remained in lunar orbit in the Apollo Command Module Columbia. When Armstrong first stepped onto the lunar surface, he famously said: \"That's one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.\" It was broadcast live to an estimated 530 million viewers worldwide. Apollo 11 was a major U.S. victory in the Space Race, by fulfilling a national goal proposed in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy \"of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth\" before the end of the decade. Along with Collins and Aldrin, Armstrong was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Richard Nixon and received the 1969 Collier Trophy. President Jimmy Carter presented him with the Congressional Space Medal of Honor in 1978, he was inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame in 1979, and with his former crewmates received the Congressional Gold Medal in 2009.\nAfter he resigned from NASA in 1971, Armstrong taught in the Department of Aerospace Engineering at the University of Cincinnati until 1979. He served on the Apollo 13 accident investigation and on the Rogers Commission, which investigated the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster. In 2012, Armstrong died because of complications resulting from coronary bypass surgery, at the age of 82.",

      "content": "Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (13 February 1835 – 26 May 1908) was an Indian religious leader and the founder of the Ahmadiyya movement in Islam. He claimed to have been divinely appointed as the promised Messiah and Mahdī, in fulfillment of the Islamic prophecies regarding the end times, as well as the Mujaddid (centennial reviver) of the 14th Islamic century.\nBorn to a family with aristocratic roots in Qadian, rural Punjab, Ahmad emerged as a writer and debater for Islam. When he was just over forty years of age, his father died and around that time he claimed that God began to communicate with him. In 1889, he took a pledge of allegiance from forty of his supporters at Ludhiana and formed a community of followers upon what he claimed was divine instruction, stipulating ten conditions of initiation, an event that marks the establishment of the Ahmadiyya movement. The mission of the movement, according to him, was the reinstatement of the absolute oneness of God, the revival of Islam through the moral reformation of society along Islamic ideals, and the global propagation of Islam in its pristine form. As opposed to the Christian and mainstream Islamic view of Jesus (or Isa), being alive in heaven to return towards the end of time, Ahmad asserted that he had in fact survived crucifixion and died a natural death. He traveled extensively across the Punjab preaching his religious ideas and rallied support by combining a reformist programme with his personal revelations which he claimed to receive from God, attracting thereby substantial following within his lifetime as well as considerable hostility particularly from the Muslim Ulama. He is known to have engaged in numerous public debates and dialogues with Christian missionaries, Muslim scholars and Hindu revivalists.\nAhmad was a prolific author and wrote more than ninety books on various religious, theological and moral subjects between the publication of the first volume of Barahin-i-Ahmadiyya (The Proofs of Ahmadiyya, his first major work) in 1880 and his death in May 1908. Many of his writings bear a polemical and apologetic tone in favour of Islam, seeking to establish its superiority as a religion through rational argumentation, often by articulating his own interpretations of Islamic teachings. He advocated a peaceful propagation of Islam and emphatically argued against the permissibility of military Jihad under circumstances prevailing in the present age. By the time of his death, he had gathered an estimated 400,000 followers, especially within the United Provinces, the Punjab and Sindh and had built a dynamic religious organisation with an executive body and its own printing press. After his death he was succeeded by his close companion Hakīm Noor-ud-Dīn who assumed the title of Khalīfatul Masīh (successor of the Messiah).\nAlthough Ahmad is revered by Ahmadi Muslims as the promised Messiah and Imām Mahdi, Muhammad nevertheless remains the central figure in Ahmadiyya Islam. Ahmad's claim to be a subordinate (ummati) prophet within Islam has remained a central point of controversy between his followers and mainstream Muslims, who believe Muhammad to be the last prophet.",

      "title": "Mathematics and art",
      "content": "Mathematics and art are related in a variety of ways. Mathematics has itself been described as an art motivated by beauty. Mathematics can be discerned in arts such as music, dance, painting, architecture, sculpture, and textiles. This article focuses, however, on mathematics in the visual arts.\nMathematics and art have a long historical relationship. Artists have used mathematics since the 4th century BC when the Greek sculptor Polykleitos wrote his Canon, prescribing proportions conjectured to have been based on the ratio 1:√2 for the ideal male nude. Persistent popular claims have been made for the use of the golden ratio in ancient art and architecture, without reliable evidence. In the Italian Renaissance, Luca Pacioli wrote the influential treatise De divina proportione (1509), illustrated with woodcuts by Leonardo da Vinci, on the use of the golden ratio in art. Another Italian painter, Piero della Francesca, developed Euclid's ideas on perspective in treatises such as De Prospectiva Pingendi, and in his paintings. The engraver Albrecht Dürer made many references to mathematics in his work Melencolia I. In modern times, the graphic artist M. C. Escher made intensive use of tessellation and hyperbolic geometry, with the help of the mathematician H. S. M. Coxeter, while the De Stijl movement led by Theo van Doesburg and Piet Mondrian explicitly embraced geometrical forms. Mathematics has inspired textile arts such as quilting, knitting, cross-stitch, crochet, embroidery, weaving, Turkish and other carpet-making, as well as kilim. In Islamic art, symmetries are evident in forms as varied as Persian girih and Moroccan zellige tilework, Mughal jali pierced stone screens, and widespread muqarnas vaulting.\nMathematics has directly influenced art with conceptual tools such as linear perspective, the analysis of symmetry, and mathematical objects such as polyhedra and the Möbius strip. Magnus Wenninger creates colourful stellated polyhedra, originally as models for teaching. Mathematical concepts such as recursion and logical paradox can be seen in paintings by René Magritte and in engravings by M. C. Escher. Computer art often makes use of fractals including the Mandelbrot set, and sometimes explores other mathematical objects such as cellular automata. Controversially, the artist David Hockney has argued that artists from the Renaissance onwards made use of the camera lucida to draw precise representations of scenes; the architect Philip Steadman similarly argued that Vermeer used the camera obscura in his distinctively observed paintings.\nOther relationships include the algorithmic analysis of artworks by X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, the finding that traditional batiks from different regions of Java have distinct fractal dimensions, and stimuli to mathematics research, especially Filippo Brunelleschi's theory of perspective, which eventually led to Girard Desargues's projective geometry. A persistent view, based ultimately on the Pythagorean notion of harmony in music, holds that everything was arranged by Number, that God is the geometer of the world, and that therefore the world's geometry is sacred.",

      "title": "James Webb Space Telescope",
      "content": "The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is a space telescope designed to conduct infrared astronomy. As the largest telescope in space, it is equipped with high-resolution and high-sensitivity instruments, allowing it to view objects too old, distant, or faint for the Hubble Space Telescope. This enables investigations across many fields of astronomy and cosmology, such as observation of the first stars and the formation of the first galaxies, and detailed atmospheric characterization of potentially habitable exoplanets.\nAlthough the Webb's mirror diameter is 2.7 times larger than that of the Hubble Space Telescope, it produces images of comparable resolution because it observes in the longer-wavelength infrared spectrum. The longer the wavelength of the spectrum, the larger the information-gathering surface required (mirrors in the infrared spectrum or antenna area in the millimeter and radio ranges) for an image comparable in clarity to the visible spectrum of the Hubble Space Telescope.\nThe Webb was launched on 25 December 2021 on an Ariane 5 rocket from Kourou, French Guiana. In January 2022 it arrived at its destination, a solar orbit near the Sun–Earth L2 Lagrange point, about 1.5 million kilometers (930,000 mi) from Earth. The telescope's first image was released to the public on 11 July 2022.\nThe U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) led Webb's design and development and partnered with two main agencies: the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA). The NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland managed telescope development, while the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore on the Homewood Campus of Johns Hopkins University operates Webb. The primary contractor for the project was Northrop Grumman.\nThe telescope is named after James E. Webb, who was the administrator of NASA from 1961 to 1968 during the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo programs.\nWebb's primary mirror consists of 18 hexagonal mirror segments made of gold-plated beryllium, which together create a 6.5-meter-diameter (21 ft) mirror, compared with Hubble's 2.4 m (7 ft 10 in). This gives Webb a light-collecting area of about 25 m2 (270 sq ft), about six times that of Hubble. Unlike Hubble, which observes in the near ultraviolet and visible (0.1 to 0.8 μm), and near infrared (0.8–2.5 μm) spectra, Webb observes a lower frequency range, from long-wavelength visible light (red) through mid-infrared (0.6–28.5 μm). The telescope must be kept extremely cold, below 50 K (−223 °C; −370 °F), so that the infrared light emitted by the telescope itself does not interfere with the collected light. Its five-layer sunshield protects it from warming by the Sun, Earth, and Moon.\nInitial designs for the telescope, then named the Next Generation Space Telescope, began in 1996. Two concept studies were commissioned in 1999, for a potential launch in 2007 and a US$1 billion budget. The program was plagued with enormous cost overruns and delays. A major redesign was accomplished in 2005, with construction completed in 2016, followed by years of exhaustive testing, at a total cost of US$10 billion.",

      "title": "Exoplanet",
      "content": "An exoplanet or extrasolar planet is a planet outside of the Solar System. The first confirmed detection of an exoplanet was in 1992 around a pulsar, and the first detection around a main-sequence star was in 1995. A different planet, first detected in 1988, was confirmed in 2003. In 2016, it was recognized that the first possible evidence of an exoplanet had been noted in 1917.  As of 26 June 2025, there are 5,926 confirmed exoplanets in 4,419 planetary systems, with 996 systems having more than one planet. In collaboration with ground-based and other space-based observatories the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is expected to give more insight into exoplanet traits, such as their composition, environmental conditions, and potential for life.\nThere are many methods of detecting exoplanets. Transit photometry and Doppler spectroscopy have found the most, but these methods suffer from a clear observational bias favoring the detection of planets near the star; thus, 85% of the exoplanets detected are inside the tidal locking zone. In several cases, multiple planets have been observed around a star. About 1 in 5 Sun-like stars are estimated to have an \"Earth-sized\" planet in the habitable zone. Assuming there are 200 billion stars in the Milky Way, it can be hypothesized that there are 11 billion potentially habitable Earth-sized planets in the Milky Way, rising to 40 billion if planets orbiting the numerous red dwarfs are included.\nThe least massive exoplanet known is Draugr (also known as PSR B1257+12 A or PSR B1257+12 b), which is about twice the mass of the Moon. The most massive exoplanet listed on the NASA Exoplanet Archive is HR 2562 b, about 30 times the mass of Jupiter. However, according to some definitions of a planet (based on the nuclear fusion of deuterium), it is too massive to be a planet and might be a brown dwarf. Known orbital times for exoplanets vary from less than an hour (for those closest to their star) to thousands of years. Some exoplanets are so far away from the star that it is difficult to tell whether they are gravitationally bound to it.\nAlmost all planets detected so far are within the Milky Way. However, there is evidence that extragalactic planets, exoplanets located in other galaxies, may exist. The nearest exoplanets are located 4.2 light-years (1.3 parsecs) from Earth and orbit Proxima Centauri, the closest star to the Sun.\nThe discovery of exoplanets has intensified interest in the search for extraterrestrial life. There is special interest in planets that orbit in a star's habitable zone (sometimes called \"goldilocks zone\"), where it is possible for liquid water, a prerequisite for life as we know it, to exist on the surface. However, the study of planetary habitability also considers a wide range of other factors in determining the suitability of a planet for hosting life.\nRogue planets are those that are not in planetary systems. Such objects are generally considered in a separate category from planets, especially if they are gas giants, often counted as sub-brown dwarfs. The rogue planets in the Milky Way possibly number in the billions or more.",

      "title": "Evangelicalism",
      "content": "Evangelicalism (), also called evangelical Christianity or evangelical Protestantism, is a worldwide, interdenominational movement within Protestant Christianity that emphasizes evangelism, or the preaching and spreading of the Christian gospel. The term evangelical is derived from the Koine Greek word euangelion, meaning \"good news,\" in reference to the message of salvation through Jesus Christ. Evangelicalism typically places a strong emphasis on personal conversion, often described as being \"born again,\" and regards the Bible as the ultimate authority in matters of faith and practice. The definition and scope of evangelicalism are subjects of debate among theologians and scholars. Some critics argue that the term encompasses a wide and diverse range of beliefs and practices, making it difficult to define as a coherent or unified movement.\nThe theological roots of evangelicalism can be traced to the Protestant Reformation in 16th-century Europe, particularly Martin Luther's 1517 Ninety-five Theses, which emphasized the authority of Scripture and the preaching of the gospel over church tradition. The modern evangelical movement is generally dated to around 1738, influenced by theological currents such as Pietism, Puritanism, Quakerism, and Moravianism—notably the work of Nicolaus Zinzendorf and the Herrnhut community. Evangelicalism gained momentum during the First Great Awakening, with figures like John Wesley and the early Methodists playing central roles. \nIt has had a longstanding presence in the Anglosphere, particularly in the United Kingdom and the United States, before expanding globally in the 19th, 20th, and early 21st centuries. The movement grew substantially during the 18th and 19th centuries, notably through the series of religious revivals known as the Great Awakening in the United States and various revival movements and reform efforts in Britain. Today, evangelicals are found across many Protestant denominations and global contexts, without being confined to a single tradition. Notable evangelical leaders have included Zinzendorf, George Fox, Wesley, George Whitefield, Jonathan Edwards, Billy Graham, Bill Bright, Harold Ockenga, Gudina Tumsa, John Stott, Francisco Olazábal, William J. Seymour, Luis Palau, Os Guinness, and Martyn Lloyd-Jones. \nAs of 2016, an estimated 619 million people identified as evangelical Christians worldwide, accounting for roughly one in four Christians. In the United States, evangelicals make up about a quarter of the population and represent the largest religious group. A growing number of individuals, often referred to as exvangelicals, have left evangelicalism due to discrimination, abuse, or theological disillusionment. Evangelicalism is a transdenominational movement found across many Protestant denominations, including Reformed traditions such as Presbyterianism and Congregationalism, Anglicanism, Plymouth Brethren, Baptists, Methodism (especially in the Wesleyan–Arminian tradition), Lutheranism, Moravians, Free Church bodies, Mennonites, Quakers, Pentecostal and charismatic movements, and various non-denominational churches.",

      "title": "Kuiper belt",
      "content": "The Kuiper belt (  KY-pər) is a circumstellar disc in the outer Solar System, extending from the orbit of Neptune at 30 astronomical units (AU) to approximately 50 AU from the Sun. It is similar to the asteroid belt, but is far larger—20 times as wide and 20–200 times as massive. Like the asteroid belt, it consists mainly of small bodies or remnants from when the Solar System formed. While many asteroids are composed primarily of rock and metal, most Kuiper belt objects are composed largely of frozen volatiles (termed \"ices\"), such as methane, ammonia, and water. The Kuiper belt is home to most of the objects that astronomers generally accept as dwarf planets:  Orcus, Pluto, Haumea, Quaoar, and Makemake. Some of the Solar System's moons, such as Neptune's Triton and Saturn's Phoebe, may have originated in the region.\nThe Kuiper belt is named in honor of the Dutch astronomer Gerard Kuiper, who conjectured the existence of the belt in 1951. There were researchers before and after him who also speculated on its existence, such as Kenneth Edgeworth in the 1930s. The astronomer Julio Angel Fernandez published a paper in 1980 suggesting the existence of a comet belt beyond Neptune which could serve as a source for short-period comets.\nIn 1992, minor planet (15760) Albion was discovered, the first Kuiper belt object (KBO) since Pluto (in 1930) and Charon (in 1978). Since its discovery, the number of known KBOs has increased to thousands, and more than 100,000 KBOs over 100 km (62 mi) in diameter are thought to exist. The Kuiper belt was initially thought to be the main repository for periodic comets, those with orbits lasting less than 200 years. Studies since the mid-1990s have shown that the belt is dynamically stable and that comets' true place of origin is the scattered disc, a dynamically active zone created by the outward motion of Neptune 4.5 billion years ago; scattered disc objects such as Eris have extremely eccentric orbits that take them as far as 100 AU from the Sun.\nThe Kuiper belt is distinct from the hypothesized Oort cloud, which is believed to be a thousand times more distant and mostly spherical. The objects within the Kuiper belt, together with the members of the scattered disc and any potential Hills cloud or Oort cloud objects, are collectively referred to as trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs). Pluto is the largest and most massive member of the Kuiper belt and the largest and the second-most-massive known TNO, surpassed only by Eris in the scattered disc. Originally considered a planet, Pluto's status as part of the Kuiper belt caused it to be reclassified as a dwarf planet in 2006. It is compositionally similar to many other objects of the Kuiper belt, and its orbital period is characteristic of a class of KBOs, known as \"plutinos,\" that share the same 2:3 resonance with Neptune.\nThe Kuiper belt and Neptune may be treated as a marker of the extent of the Solar System, alternatives being the heliopause and the distance at which the Sun's gravitational influence is matched by that of other stars (estimated to be between 50000 AU and 125000 AU).",

      "title": "General relativity",
      "content": "General relativity, also known as the general theory of relativity, and as Einstein's theory of gravity, is the geometric theory of gravitation published by Albert Einstein in 1915 and is the currently accepted description of gravitation in modern physics. General relativity generalizes special relativity and refines Newton's law of universal gravitation, providing a unified description of gravity as a geometric property of space and time, or four-dimensional spacetime. In particular, the curvature of spacetime is directly related to the energy, momentum and stress of whatever is present, including matter and radiation. The relation is specified by the Einstein field equations, a system of second-order partial differential equations.\nNewton's law of universal gravitation, which describes gravity in classical mechanics, can be seen as a prediction of general relativity for the almost flat spacetime geometry around stationary mass distributions. Some predictions of general relativity, however, are beyond Newton's law of universal gravitation in classical physics. These predictions concern the passage of time, the geometry of space, the motion of bodies in free fall, and the propagation of light, and include gravitational time dilation, gravitational lensing, the gravitational redshift of light, the Shapiro time delay and singularities/black holes. So far, all tests of general relativity have been in agreement with the theory. The time-dependent solutions of general relativity enable us extrapolate the history of the universe into the past and future, and have provided the modern framework for cosmology, thus leading to the discovery of the Big Bang and cosmic microwave background radiation. Despite the introduction of a number of alternative theories, general relativity continues to be the simplest theory consistent with experimental data.\nReconciliation of general relativity with the laws of quantum physics remains a problem, however, as no self-consistent theory of quantum gravity has been found. It is not yet known how gravity can be unified with the three non-gravitational interactions: strong, weak and electromagnetic.\nEinstein's theory has astrophysical implications, including the prediction of black holes—regions of space in which space and time are distorted in such a way that nothing, not even light, can escape from them. Black holes are the end-state for massive stars. Microquasars and active galactic nuclei are believed to be stellar black holes and supermassive black holes. It also predicts gravitational lensing, where the bending of light results in distorted and multiple images of the same distant astronomical phenomenon. Other predictions include the existence of gravitational waves, which have been observed directly by the physics collaboration LIGO and other observatories. In addition, general relativity has provided the basis for cosmological models of an expanding universe.\nWidely acknowledged as a theory of extraordinary beauty, general relativity has often been described as the most beautiful of all existing physical theories.",

      "title": "Supernova nucleosynthesis",
      "content": "Supernova nucleosynthesis is the nucleosynthesis of chemical elements in supernova explosions.\nIn sufficiently massive stars, the nucleosynthesis by fusion of lighter elements into heavier ones occurs during sequential hydrostatic burning processes called helium burning, carbon burning, oxygen burning, and silicon burning, in which the byproducts of one nuclear fuel become, after compressional heating, the fuel for the subsequent burning stage. In this context, the word \"burning\" refers to nuclear fusion and not a chemical reaction.\nDuring hydrostatic burning these fuels synthesize overwhelmingly the alpha nuclides (A = 2Z), nuclei composed of integer numbers of helium-4 nuclei. Initially, two helium-4 nuclei fuse into a single beryllium-8 nucleus. The addition of another helium 4 nucleus to the beryllium yields carbon-12, followed by oxygen-16, neon-20 and so on, each time adding 2 protons and 2 neutrons to the growing nucleus. A rapid final explosive burning is caused by the sudden temperature spike owing to passage of the radially moving shock wave that was launched by the gravitational collapse of the core. W. D. Arnett and his Rice University colleagues demonstrated that the final shock burning would synthesize the non-alpha-nucleus isotopes more effectively than hydrostatic burning was able to do, suggesting that the expected shock-wave nucleosynthesis is an essential component of supernova nucleosynthesis. Together, shock-wave nucleosynthesis and hydrostatic-burning processes create most of the isotopes of the elements carbon (Z = 6), oxygen (Z = 8), and elements with Z = 10 to 28 (from neon to nickel). As a result of the ejection of the newly synthesized isotopes of the chemical elements by supernova explosions, their abundances steadily increased within interstellar gas. That increase became evident to astronomers from the initial abundances in newly born stars exceeding those in earlier-born stars.\nElements heavier than nickel are comparatively rare owing to the decline with atomic weight of their nuclear binding energies per nucleon, but they too are created in part within supernovae. Of greatest interest historically has been their synthesis by rapid capture of neutrons during the r-process, reflecting the common belief that supernova cores are likely to provide the necessary conditions. However, newer research has proposed a promising alternative (see the r-process below). The r-process isotopes are approximately 100,000 times less abundant than the primary chemical elements fused in supernova shells above. Furthermore, other nucleosynthesis processes in supernovae are thought to be responsible also for some nucleosynthesis of other heavy elements, notably, the proton capture process known as the rp-process,  the slow capture of neutrons (s-process) in the helium-burning shells and in the carbon-burning shells of massive stars, and a photodisintegration process known as the γ-process (gamma-process). The latter synthesizes the lightest, most neutron-poor, isotopes of the elements heavier than iron from preexisting heavier isotopes.",

      "title": "EarthBound",
      "content": "EarthBound, originally released in Japan as Mother 2: Gīgu no Gyakushū, is a 1994 role-playing video game developed by Ape Inc. (now Creatures Inc.), (one of the owners of the Pokémon franchise) and HAL Laboratory and published by Nintendo for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System as the second entry in the Mother series. The game focuses on a young boy named Ness and his party of Paula, Jeff and Poo, as they travel the world to collect melodies from eight Sanctuaries in order to defeat the universal cosmic destroyer Giygas.\nEarthBound had a lengthy development period that spanned five years. Its returning staff from Mother (1989) included writer/director Shigesato Itoi and lead programmer Satoru Iwata, as well as composers Keiichi Suzuki and Hirokazu Tanaka, who incorporated a diverse range of styles into the soundtrack, including salsa, reggae, and dub. Most of the other staff members had not worked on the original Mother, and the game came under repeated threats of cancellation until Iwata joined the team. Originally scheduled for release in January 1993, the game was completed around May 1994 and first released in Japan in August 1994, and in North America in June 1995. A port for the Game Boy Advance developed by Pax Softnica, bundled with Mother, as Mother 1+2, was released only in Japan in 2003. \nLike its predecessor, EarthBound is themed around an idiosyncratic portrayal of Americana and Western culture, subverting popular role-playing game traditions by featuring a modern setting while parodying numerous staples of the genre. Itoi wanted the game to reach non-gamers with its intentionally goofy tone; for example, the player uses items such as the Pencil Eraser to remove pencil statues, experiences in-game hallucinations, and battles piles of vomit, taxi cabs, and walking nooses. For its American release, the game was marketed with a $2 million promotional campaign that sardonically proclaimed \"This game stinks\". The game's puns and humor were reworked by localizer Marcus Lindblom. Since the original Mother had not yet been released outside Japan, Mother 2 was called EarthBound to avoid confusion about what it was a sequel to.\nAlthough it was positively received by Japanese audiences, EarthBound sold poorly in the United States. Journalists attributed the game's poor sales in the West to a combination of its simple graphics, satirical marketing campaign, and a lack of market interest in the genre. In the ensuing years, a dedicated fan community spawned that advocated for the series' recognition, particularly after Ness appeared as a playable character in the Super Smash Bros. series. By the 2000s, multiple reader polls and critics had named it one of the greatest video games of all time, and it became regarded as a \"sacred cow among gaming's cognoscenti\". It was followed by the Japan-only sequel Mother 3 for the Game Boy Advance in 2006. EarthBound was later made available worldwide on the Wii U Virtual Console in 2013, 3DS Virtual Console in 2016, the SNES Classic in 2017, and the Nintendo Classics service in February 2022.",

      "title": "Comet",
      "content": "A comet is an icy, small Solar System body that warms and begins to release gases when passing close to the Sun, a process called outgassing. This produces an extended, gravitationally unbound atmosphere or coma surrounding the nucleus, and sometimes a tail of gas and dust gas blown out from the coma. These phenomena are due to the effects of solar radiation and the outstreaming solar wind plasma acting upon the nucleus of the comet. Comet nuclei range from a few hundred meters to tens of kilometers across and are composed of loose collections of ice, dust, and small rocky particles. The coma may be up to 15 times Earth's diameter, while the tail may stretch beyond one astronomical unit. If sufficiently close and bright, a comet may be seen from Earth without the aid of a telescope and can subtend an arc of up to 30° (60 Moons) across the sky. Comets have been observed and recorded since ancient times by many cultures and religions.\nComets usually have highly eccentric elliptical orbits, and they have a wide range of orbital periods, ranging from several years to potentially several millions of years. Short-period comets originate in the Kuiper belt or its associated scattered disc, which lie beyond the orbit of Neptune. Long-period comets are thought to originate in the Oort cloud, a spherical cloud of icy bodies extending from outside the Kuiper belt to halfway to the nearest star. Long-period comets are set in motion towards the Sun by gravitational perturbations from passing stars and the galactic tide. Hyperbolic comets may pass once through the inner Solar System before being flung to interstellar space. The appearance of a comet is called an apparition.\nExtinct comets that have passed close to the Sun many times have lost nearly all of their volatile ices and dust and may come to resemble small asteroids. Asteroids are thought to have a different origin from comets, having formed inside the orbit of Jupiter rather than in the outer Solar System. However, the discovery of main-belt comets and active centaur minor planets has blurred the distinction between asteroids and comets. In the early 21st century, the discovery of some minor bodies with long-period comet orbits, but characteristics of inner solar system asteroids, were called Manx comets. They are still classified as comets, such as C/2014 S3 (PANSTARRS). Twenty-seven Manx comets were found from 2013 to 2017.\nAs of November 2021, there are 4,584 known comets. However, this represents a very small fraction of the total potential comet population, as the reservoir of comet-like bodies in the outer Solar System (in the Oort cloud) is about one trillion. Roughly one comet per year is visible to the naked eye, though many of those are faint and unspectacular. Particularly bright examples are called \"great comets\". Comets have been visited by uncrewed probes such as NASA's Deep Impact, which blasted a crater on Comet Tempel 1 to study its interior, and the European Space Agency's Rosetta, which became the first to land a robotic spacecraft on a comet.",

      "content": "The Space Shuttle is a retired, partially reusable low Earth orbital spacecraft system operated from 1981 to 2011 by the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) as part of the Space Shuttle program. Its official program name was the Space Transportation System (STS), taken from the 1969 plan led by U.S. vice president Spiro Agnew for a system of reusable spacecraft where it was the only item funded for development.\nThe first (STS-1) of four orbital test flights occurred in 1981, leading to operational flights (STS-5) beginning in 1982. Five complete Space Shuttle orbiter vehicles were built and flown on a total of 135 missions from 1981 to 2011. They launched from the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in Florida. Operational missions launched numerous satellites, interplanetary probes, and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), conducted science experiments in orbit, participated in the Shuttle-Mir program with Russia, and participated in the construction and servicing of the International Space Station (ISS). The Space Shuttle fleet's total mission time was 1,323 days.\nSpace Shuttle components include the Orbiter Vehicle (OV) with three clustered Rocketdyne RS-25 main engines, a pair of recoverable solid rocket boosters (SRBs), and the expendable external tank (ET) containing liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen. The Space Shuttle was launched vertically, like a conventional rocket, with the two SRBs operating in parallel with the orbiter's three main engines, which were fueled from the ET. The SRBs were jettisoned before the vehicle reached orbit, while the main engines continued to operate, and the ET was jettisoned after main engine cutoff and just before orbit insertion, which used the orbiter's two Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS) engines. At the conclusion of the mission, the orbiter fired its OMS to deorbit and reenter the atmosphere. The orbiter was protected during reentry by its thermal protection system tiles, and it glided as a spaceplane to a runway landing, usually to the Shuttle Landing Facility at KSC, Florida, or to Rogers Dry Lake in Edwards Air Force Base, California. If the landing occurred at Edwards, the orbiter was flown back to the KSC atop the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft (SCA), a specially modified Boeing 747 designed to carry the shuttle above it.\nThe first orbiter, Enterprise, was built in 1976 and used in Approach and Landing Tests (ALT), but had no orbital capability. Four fully operational orbiters were initially built: Columbia, Challenger, Discovery, and Atlantis. Of these, two were lost in mission accidents: Challenger in 1986 and Columbia in 2003, with a total of 14 astronauts killed. A fifth operational (and sixth in total) orbiter, Endeavour, was built in 1991 to replace Challenger. The three surviving operational vehicles were retired from service following Atlantis's final flight on July 21, 2011. The U.S. relied on the Russian Soyuz spacecraft to transport astronauts to the ISS from the last Shuttle flight until the launch of the Crew Dragon Demo-2 mission in May 2020.",

      "title": "Apollo program",
      "content": "Project Apollo, also the Apollo program (1961–1972), was the United States' human spaceflight program led by NASA, which landed the first astronauts on the Moon in 1969. Project Apollo was conceptualized during the time of Project Mercury (1958–1963) and was realized after Project Gemini (1961–1966). In 1960, during the Eisenhower presidency (1953–1961), the Apollo Program was conceptualized to feature a three-astronaut spacecraft, and later was dedicated to Pres. Kennedy's national goal for NASA in the 1960s, of \"landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth\", proposed in a speech to the U.S. Congress on May 25, 1961.\nThe Apollo 11 mission accomplished Kennedy's goal when the astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed the Apollo Lunar Module (LM) Eagle on the Moon on July 20, 1969, while Michael Collins remained in lunar orbit in the command and service module (CSM). All three astronauts landed safely on Earth in the Pacific Ocean on July 24, 1969. Subsequently, five Apollo missions also landed astronauts on the Moon, the last, Apollo 17, in December 1972. In these six spaceflights, twelve astronauts walked on the Moon.\nProject Apollo ran from 1961 to 1972, with the first crewed spaceflight in 1968, but earlier had suffered a disaster in 1967, when, during a pre-launching test, the Apollo 1 cabin atmosphere caught fire and killed the three astronauts. After the first Moon landing on 20 July, 1969, sufficient numbers of spacecraft and rockets remained for fielding nine landings on the Moon, with a plan for extended geological and astrophysical lunar exploration; but a reduced budget for NASA cancelled three planned lunar missions. Moreover, of the remaining six lunar missions, five landed on the Moon; but the Apollo 13 landing was aborted when an oxygen tank exploded and crippled the Apollo 13 CSM en route to the Moon. The resourceful crew of astronauts used the Lunar Module as a lifeboat to safely return from the Moon to the Earth. \nProject Apollo set several spaceflight milestones in the 1957–1969 period, sending crewed missions beyond low Earth orbit. Apollo 8 was the first crewed spacecraft to orbit another celestial body, the Moon, and Apollo 11 was the first crewed mission to land astronauts on another celestial body. Project Apollo delivered 842 pounds (382 kg) of lunar rocks and soil to Earth, contributing to the geologic understanding of the Moon's composition and history. The Apollo program was the foundation for NASA's human spaceflight capabilities, housed at the Johnson Space Center in Texas and the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Apollo also advanced many technologies (avionics, telecommunications, computers) incidental to rocketry and to human spaceflight. Project Apollo used the models of Saturn rockets as the launching vehicles for the Apollo Applications Program, which comprised the space station Skylab (1973–1974), which supported the astronaut crews of three missions, and the Apollo–Soyuz Test Project, a joint U.S.–U.S.S.R. low Earth orbit mission in 1975.",

      "title": "Venus and Adonis (Titian)",
      "content": "A composition of Venus and Adonis by the Venetian Renaissance artist Titian has been painted a number of times, by Titian himself, by his studio assistants and by others.  In all there are some thirty versions that may date from the 16th century, the nudity of Venus undoubtedly accounting for this popularity.  It is unclear which of the surviving versions, if any, is the original or prime version, and a matter of debate how much involvement Titian himself had with surviving versions.  There is a precise date for only one version, that in the Prado in Madrid, which is documented in correspondence between Titian and Philip II of Spain in 1554.  However, this appears to be a later repetition of a composition first painted a considerable time earlier, possibly as early as the 1520s.\nThe Prado version is set at dawn and shows the young Adonis pulling himself away from Venus, his lover.  He carries a feathered spear or \"dart\", a weapon often used in hunting in the 16th century. The leads of his three hounds are wound around his arm at right. Under the trees behind them at left Cupid lies asleep, with his bow and quiver of arrows hanging from a tree; this is not a time for love.  High in the sky, a figure rides a chariot; this is either Venus from later in the story, or Apollo or Sol, representing the dawn.  Venus sits on a rock covered with a rich tablecloth with gold braid edges and buttons (not a military jacket, as sometimes thought).  Adonis has a horn hanging from his belt; his dress is classical, taken from Roman sculptures.\nIt is thought that the Roman poet Ovid was the main source, though other literary and visual sources have been suggested.  In Book X of Ovid's Metamorphoses Adonis is a beautiful youth, a royal orphan, who spends his time hunting.  Venus falls in love with him after one of Cupid's arrows hits her by mistake. They hunt together, but she avoids the fiercer animals, and warns him about them, citing the story of Atalanta.  One day Adonis hunts alone and is gored by a wounded wild boar.  Venus, in the sky in her chariot, hears his cries but cannot save him.  In some versions, the death of Adonis is shown in the distance to the right.  In Ovid, it is Venus who leaves first, and Adonis pulling himself away seems to be Titian's invention, for which some criticized him.\n\nTwo basic types of the composition were described by Harold Wethey, who called them the \"Prado\" and \"Farnese\" types; the Prado type is most common and is described above.  Alternative terms are the \"three-dog\" and \"two-dog\" types.  They are in most respects the same, but the Farnese type has a tighter crop on the subject and a wider shape, losing most of the sky.  Adonis' raised hand is just below the picture edge, so the feathers on the spear are not seen, nor is the chariot in the sky, though the sun bursts through clouds in about the same place.  There are only two hounds and no gold vessel on the ground at left.  Cupid is brought closer to the main couple, and is now awake, holding a dove in his hands.",

      "title": "Planetary Science with Balloon-Borne Telescopes",
      "content": "The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the planetary science community have recently been exploring the potential contributions of stratospheric balloons to the planetary science field. A study that was recently concluded explored the roughly 200 or so science questions raised in the Planetary Decadal Survey report and found that about 45 of those questions are suited to stratospheric balloon based observations. In September of 2014, a stratospheric balloon mission called BOPPS (which stands for Balloon Observation Platform for Planetary Science) was flown out of Fort Sumner, New Mexico. The mission had two main objectives, first, to observe a number of planetary targets including one or more Oort cloud comets and second, to demonstrate the applicability and performance of the platform, instruments, and subsystems for making scientific measurements in support planetary science objectives. BOPPS carried two science instruments, BIRC and UVVis. BIRC is a cryogenic infrared multispectral imager which can image in the.6-5 m range using an HgCdTe detector. Narrow band filters were used to allow detection of water and CO2 emission features of the observed targets. The UVVis is an imager with the science range of 300 to 600 nm. A main feature of the UVVis instrument is the incorporation of a guide camera and a Fine Steering Mirror (FSM) system to reduce image jitter to less than 100 milliarcseconds. The BIRC instrument was used to image targets including Oort cloud comets Siding Spring and Jacques, and the dwarf planet 1 Ceres. BOPPS achieved the first ever earth based CO2 observation of a comet and the first images of water and CO2 of an Oort cloud comet (Jacques). It also made the first ever measurement of 1Ceres at 2.73 m to refine the shape of the infrared water absorption feature on that body. The UVVis instrument, mounted on its own optics bench, demonstrated the capability for image correction both from atmospheric disturbances as well as some of the residual motion from the gondola that was not addressed by the gondolas coarse pointing systems. The mission met its primary science and engineering objectives. The results of the BOPPS mission will feed into the body of science knowledge but also feed into future planning for more science from balloon-borne platforms. A notional platform called Gondola for High-Altitude Planetary Science (GHAPS) has been explored and this concept platform can address a number of important decadal questions. This paper provides a summary of the assessment of potential balloon borne observations for planetary science purposes including where potential science contributions can be expected, the necessary performance characteristics of the platform, and other features required or desired. The BOPPS mission is summarized including descriptions of the main elements and key science and engineering results. The paper then briefly describes GHAPS, and the salient features that can make it a valuable tool for future planetary observations.",

      "content": "New Horizons is an interplanetary space probe launched as a part of NASA's New Frontiers program. Engineered by the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) and the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI), with a team led by Alan Stern, the spacecraft was launched in 2006 with the primary mission to perform a flyby study of the Pluto system in 2015, and a secondary mission to fly by and study one or more other Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) in the decade to follow, which became a mission to 486958 Arrokoth. It is the fifth space probe to achieve the escape velocity needed to leave the Solar System.\nOn January 19, 2006, New Horizons was launched from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station by an Atlas V rocket directly into an Earth-and-solar escape trajectory with a speed of about 16.26 km/s (10.10 mi/s; 58,500 km/h; 36,400 mph). It was the fastest (average speed with respect to Earth) human-made object ever launched from Earth. It is not the fastest speed recorded for a spacecraft, which, as of 2023, is that of the Parker Solar Probe. After a brief encounter with asteroid 132524 APL, New Horizons proceeded to Jupiter, making its closest approach on February 28, 2007, at a distance of 2.3 million kilometers (1.4 million miles). The Jupiter flyby provided a gravity assist that increased New Horizons' speed; the flyby also enabled a general test of New Horizons' scientific capabilities, returning data about the planet's atmosphere, moons, and magnetosphere.\nMost of the post-Jupiter voyage was spent in hibernation mode to preserve onboard systems, except for brief annual checkouts. On December 6, 2014, New Horizons was brought back online for the Pluto encounter, and instrument check-out began. On January 15, 2015, the spacecraft began its approach phase to Pluto.\nOn July 14, 2015, at 11:49 UTC, it flew 12,500 km (7,800 mi) above the surface of Pluto, which at the time was 34 AU from the Sun, making it the first spacecraft to explore the dwarf planet. In August 2016, New Horizons was reported to have traveled at speeds of more than 84,000 km/h (52,000 mph). On October 25, 2016, at 21:48 UTC, the last recorded data from the Pluto flyby was received from New Horizons. Having completed its flyby of Pluto, New Horizons then maneuvered for a flyby of Kuiper belt object 486958 Arrokoth (then nicknamed Ultima Thule), which occurred on January 1, 2019, when it was 43.4 AU (6.49 billion km; 4.03 billion mi) from the Sun. In August 2018, NASA cited results by Alice on New Horizons to confirm the existence of a \"hydrogen wall\" at the outer edges of the Solar System. This \"wall\" was first detected in 1992 by the two Voyager spacecraft. \nNew Horizons is traveling through the Kuiper belt; it is 61.08 AU (9.14 billion km; 5.68 billion mi) from Earth and 61.99 AU (9.27 billion km; 5.76 billion mi) from the Sun as of June 2025. NASA has announced it is to extend operations for New Horizons until the spacecraft exits the Kuiper belt, which is expected to occur in either 2028 or 2029.",

      "title": "String theory",
      "content": "In physics, string theory is a theoretical framework in which the point-like particles of particle physics are replaced by one-dimensional objects called strings. String theory describes how these strings propagate through space and interact with each other. On distance scales larger than the string scale, a string acts like a particle, with its mass, charge, and other properties determined by the vibrational state of the string. In string theory, one of the many vibrational states of the string corresponds to the graviton, a quantum mechanical particle that carries the gravitational force. Thus, string theory is a theory of quantum gravity.\nString theory is a broad and varied subject that attempts to address a number of deep questions of fundamental physics. String theory has contributed a number of advances to mathematical physics, which have been applied to a variety of problems in black hole physics, early universe cosmology, nuclear physics, and condensed matter physics, and it has stimulated a number of major developments in pure mathematics. Because string theory potentially provides a unified description of gravity and particle physics, it is a candidate for a theory of everything, a self-contained mathematical model that describes all fundamental forces and forms of matter. Despite much work on these problems, it is not known to what extent string theory describes the real world or how much freedom the theory allows in the choice of its details.\nString theory was first studied in the late 1960s as a theory of the strong nuclear force, before being abandoned in favor of quantum chromodynamics. Subsequently, it was realized that the very properties that made string theory unsuitable as a theory of nuclear physics made it a promising candidate for a quantum theory of gravity. The earliest version of string theory, bosonic string theory, incorporated only the class of particles known as bosons. It later developed into superstring theory, which posits a connection called supersymmetry between bosons and the class of particles called fermions. Five consistent versions of superstring theory were developed before it was conjectured in the mid-1990s that they were all different limiting cases of a single theory in eleven dimensions known as M-theory. In late 1997, theorists discovered an important relationship called the anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory correspondence (AdS/CFT correspondence), which relates string theory to another type of physical theory called a quantum field theory.\nOne of the challenges of string theory is that the full theory does not have a satisfactory definition in all circumstances. Another issue is that the theory is thought to describe an enormous landscape of possible universes, which has complicated efforts to develop theories of particle physics based on string theory. These issues have led some in the community to criticize these approaches to physics, and to question the value of continued research on string theory unification.",

An impact by a sufficiently large asteroid or other NEOs would cause, depending on its impact location, massive tsunamis or multiple firestorms, and an impact winter caused by the sunlight-blocking effect of large quantities of pulverized rock dust and other debris placed into the stratosphere. A collision 66 million years ago between the Earth and an object approximately 10 kilometers (6 miles) wide is thought to have produced the Chicxulub crater and triggered the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event that is understood by the scientific community to have caused the extinction of all non-avian dinosaurs.\nWhile the chances of a major collision are low in the near term, it is a near-certainty that one will happen eventually unless defensive measures are taken. Astronomical events—such as the Shoemaker-Levy 9 impacts on Jupiter and the 2013 Chelyabinsk meteor, along with the growing number of near-Earth objects discovered and catalogued on the Sentry Risk Table—have drawn renewed attention to such threats. The popularity of the 2021 movie Don't Look Up helped to raise awareness of the possibility of avoiding NEOs. Awareness of the threat has grown rapidly during the past few decades, but much more needs to be accomplished before the human population can feel adequately protected from a potentially catastrophic asteroid impact.\nIn 2016, a NASA scientist warned that the Earth is unprepared for such an event. In April 2018, the B612 Foundation reported \"It's 100 percent certain we'll be hit by a devastating asteroid, but we're not 100 percent sure when.\" Also in 2018, physicist Stephen Hawking, in his final book, Brief Answers to the Big Questions, considered an asteroid collision to be the biggest threat to the planet. \nSeveral ways of avoiding an asteroid impact have been described. There are two primary ways: to modify the trajectory of the object so that it does not collide with the Earth, or to modify the object by breaking it up so that the resulting fragments do not collide with the Earth or their\nsmaller size reduces the subsequent hazard posed to the Earth.\nNonetheless, in March 2019, scientists reported that asteroids may be much more difficult to destroy than thought earlier. An asteroid may reassemble itself due to gravity after being disrupted. In May 2021, NASA astronomers reported that 5 to 10 years of preparation may be needed to avoid a virtual impactor based on a simulated exercise conducted by the 2021 Planetary Defense Conference.\nIn 2022, NASA spacecraft DART impacted Dimorphos, reducing the minor-planet moon's orbital period by 32 minutes. This mission constitutes the first successful attempt at asteroid deflection. In 2027, China plans to launch a deflection mission to the near-Earth object 2015 XF261, with the impact estimated to occur in April 2029.",

      "title": "Black hole",
      "content": "A black hole is a massive, compact astronomical object so dense that its gravity prevents anything from escaping, even light. Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass will form a black hole. The boundary of no escape is called the event horizon. A black hole has a great effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it, but has no locally detectable features according to general relativity. In many ways, a black hole acts like an ideal black body, as it reflects no light.  Quantum field theory in curved spacetime predicts that event horizons emit Hawking radiation, with the same spectrum as a black body of a temperature inversely proportional to its mass. This temperature is of the order of billionths of a kelvin for stellar black holes, making it essentially impossible to observe directly.\nObjects whose gravitational fields are too strong for light to escape were first considered in the 18th century by John Michell and Pierre-Simon Laplace. In 1916, Karl Schwarzschild found the first modern solution of general relativity that would characterise a black hole. Due to his influential research, the Schwarzschild metric is named after him. David Finkelstein, in 1958, first published the interpretation of \"black hole\" as a region of space from which nothing can escape. Black holes were long considered a mathematical curiosity; it was not until the 1960s that theoretical work showed they were a generic prediction of general relativity. The first black hole known was Cygnus X-1, identified by several researchers independently in 1971.\nBlack holes typically form when massive stars collapse at the end of their life cycle. After a black hole has formed, it can grow by absorbing mass from its surroundings. Supermassive black holes of millions of solar masses may form by absorbing other stars and merging with other black holes, or via direct collapse of gas clouds. There is consensus that supermassive black holes exist in the centres of most galaxies.\nThe presence of a black hole can be inferred through its interaction with other matter and with electromagnetic radiation such as visible light. Matter falling toward a black hole can form an accretion disk of infalling plasma, heated by friction and emitting light. In extreme cases, this creates a quasar, some of the brightest objects in the universe. Stars passing too close to a supermassive black hole can be shredded into streamers that shine very brightly before being \"swallowed.\" If other stars are orbiting a black hole, their orbits can be used to determine the black hole's mass and location. Such observations can be used to exclude possible alternatives such as neutron stars. In this way, astronomers have identified numerous stellar black hole candidates in binary systems and established that the radio source known as Sagittarius A*, at the core of the Milky Way galaxy, contains a supermassive black hole of about 4.3 million solar masses.",

      "content": "Evanescence is an American rock band founded in 1994 by singer and keyboardist Amy Lee and guitarist Ben Moody in Little Rock, Arkansas. After releasing independent EPs and a demo CD as a duo in the late 1990s, Evanescence released their debut studio album, Fallen, on Wind-up Records in 2003. Propelled by the success of hit singles like \"Bring Me to Life\" and \"My Immortal\", Fallen sold more than four million copies in the US by January 2004, garnering Evanescence two Grammy Awards out of six nominations. They released their first live album and concert DVD, Anywhere but Home, in 2004, which sold over one million copies worldwide.\nEvanescence released their second studio album, The Open Door, in 2006, co-composed by Lee and guitarist Terry Balsamo. It received a Grammy nomination and has sold more than six million copies worldwide. With Balsamo, guitarist Troy McLawhorn, bassist Tim McCord and drummer Will Hunt, the band reconvened in 2009 to work on music for their next album, Evanescence. Released in 2011, it marked the first album co-written as a band. It debuted at the top of the Billboard 200, Rock Albums, Digital Albums, Alternative Albums, and Hard Rock Albums charts. Following the end of the album's tour cycle, the band entered a hiatus.\nIn 2014, Lee and Evanescence left their record label and became an independent band. The band emerged from hiatus in 2015 and resumed touring, while a new album was not yet created as Lee was also focusing on a solo project. In 2016, Lee stated that Evanescence was working on a fourth album, Synthesis (2017), composed of orchestral and electronica arrangements of their previous material alongside two new songs. Its release was followed by the Synthesis Live tour, in which the band performed with live orchestras for the first time. After pandemic delays, Evanescence released their fifth studio album, The Bitter Truth, in 2021, which reached the top five of the Billboard Independent, Alternative, and Hard Rock charts.\nGenerally classified as a gothic alternative metal and hard rock band, Evanescence have a diverse sound incorporating various musical styles including classical music, alternative music, heavy metal, industrial music, and electronic music, driven by Lee's contrasting musical pursuits and introspective songwriting. Beginning as a duo partnership, Evanescence had several lineup changes, and became a band collaboration in 2009. The band comprises Lee, guitarist Tim McCord since 2006, guitarist Troy McLawhorn and drummer Will Hunt since 2007, and bassist Emma Anzai since 2022. Among other accolades, Evanescence has received two Grammy Awards, three Loudwire Music Awards, a Kerrang! Award, a Revolver Golden Gods Music Award, a Rock Sound award, a Brit Award nomination, three American Music Award nominations, and five MTV Video Music Award nominations. Evanescence have sold a total of 31.9 million albums, making the band one of the best selling hard rock and metal artists of all time.",

      "content": "Miranda Leigh Lambert (born November 10, 1983) is an American country singer. Born in Longview, Texas, she started out in early 2001 when she released her self-titled debut album independently. In 2003, she finished in third place on the television program Nashville Star, a singing competition which aired on the USA Network. Outside her solo career, she is a member of the Pistol Annies, a group she formed in 2011 alongside Ashley Monroe and Angaleena Presley. Lambert has been honored by the Grammy Awards, the Academy of Country Music Awards and the Country Music Association Awards. Lambert has been honored with more Academy of Country Music Awards than any artist in history and was named by the Chicago Tribune as the \"greatest country music artist of all time\" in 2019. In 2024, Lambert was awarded the Country Icon Award at the People's Choice Country Awards.\nAfter signing with Epic Records, she released her first Epic album and second overall 2005's Kerosene. It was certified Platinum in the United States and produced the singles \"Me and Charlie Talking\", \"Bring Me Down\", \"Kerosene\" and \"New Strings\". All four singles reached the top 40 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs. Her second album, Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, was released in early 2007. Three of its singles (\"Famous in a Small Town\", \"Gunpowder & Lead\" and \"More Like Her\") peaked within the top 20 on the country songs chart, with \"Gunpowder & Lead\" becoming her first top 10 entry in July 2008. Her third album, Revolution, was released in September 2009. Two of its songs – \"The House That Built Me\" and \"Heart Like Mine\" – topped the Hot Country Songs chart. \n2011's Four the Record included the singles \"Baggage Claim\", \"Over You\", \"Fastest Girl in Town\", \"Mama's Broken Heart\" and \"All Kinds of Kinds\". Lambert released her fifth album, Platinum, in 2014. The record won the Grammy Award for Best Country Album, and the album's lead single, \"Automatic\", reached the top five on the Country charts. Her sixth studio album, The Weight of These Wings, was released on November 18, 2016, and subsequently certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Her seventh studio album, Wildcard, was released on November 1, 2019, and went on to win the Grammy Award for Best Country Album in early 2021. Three singles from the album (\"It All Comes out in the Wash\", \"Bluebird\", \"Settling Down\") reached the top 20 of the country music charts, and the album's second official single, \"Bluebird\", became Lambert's first song to top the Billboard Country Airplay Chart as a solo artist since 2012.\nShe later collaborated with singer-songwriters Jon Randall and Jack Ingram for the album The Marfa Tapes, departing from her usual sound and opting for an acoustic, stripped-back feel. It was released on May 7, 2021, to acclaim from critics. Lambert released her eighth solo album, Palomino, on April 29, 2022. The same year she was listed on 100 Most Influential People by Time.",

      "title": "Mercury (planet)",
      "content": "Mercury is the first planet from the Sun and the smallest in the Solar System. It is a rocky planet with a trace atmosphere and a surface gravity slightly higher than that of Mars. The surface of Mercury is similar to Earth's Moon, heavily cratered, with expansive rupes system, generated from thrust faults, and bright ray systems, formed by ejecta. Its largest crater, Caloris Planitia, has a diameter of 1,550 km (960 mi), which is about one-third the diameter of the planet (4,880 km or 3,030 mi). \nBeing the most inferior orbiting planet it appears in Earth's sky, always close to the Sun, either as a \"morning star\" or an \"evening star\". It stays most of the time the closest to all other planets and is the planet with the highest delta-v needed to travel to from all other planets of the Solar System.\nMercury's sidereal year (88.0 Earth days) and sidereal day (58.65 Earth days) are in a 3:2 ratio. This relationship is called spin–orbit resonance, and sidereal here means \"relative to the stars\". Consequently, one solar day (sunrise to sunrise) on Mercury lasts for around 176 Earth days: twice the planet's sidereal year. This means that one side of Mercury will remain in sunlight for one Mercurian year of 88 Earth days; while during the next orbit, that side will be in darkness all the time until the next sunrise after another 88 Earth days. Above the planet's surface is an extremely tenuous exosphere and a faint magnetic field that is strong enough to deflect solar winds. Combined with its high orbital eccentricity, the planet's surface has widely varying sunlight intensity and temperature, with the equatorial regions ranging from −170 °C (−270 °F) at night to 420 °C (790 °F) during sunlight. Due to the very small axial tilt, the planet's poles are permanently shadowed. This strongly suggests that water ice could be present in the craters.\nLike the other planets in the Solar System, Mercury formed approximately 4.5 billion years ago. There are many competing hypotheses about Mercury's origins and development, some of which incorporate collision with planetesimals and rock vaporization; as of the early 2020s, many broad details of Mercury's geological history are still under investigation or pending data from space probes. Its mantle is highly homogeneous, which suggests that Mercury had a magma ocean early in its history, like the Moon. According to current models, Mercury may have a solid silicate crust and mantle overlying a solid outer core, a deeper liquid core layer, and a solid inner core.\nMercury is a classical planet that has been observed throughout history and recognized as a planet (or wandering star). In English, it is named after the ancient Roman god Mercurius (Mercury), god of commerce and communication, and the messenger of the gods. The first successful flyby of Mercury was conducted by Mariner 10 in 1974, and it has since been visited and explored by the MESSENGER and BepiColombo orbiters.",

      "title": "Europa (moon)",
      "content": "Europa ( ) is a natural satellite (moon) of Jupiter. Being observable from Earth with common binoculars, it is one of the four Galilean moons. As such it is a planetary-mass moon; the smallest and least massive orbiting Jupiter, and slightly smaller and less massive than Earth's. Europa is an icy moon, and, of the three icy Galilean moons, the closest orbiting Jupiter. As a result, it exhibits a relatively young surface, driven by tidal heating.\nProbably having an iron–nickel core, it consists mainly of silicate rock, with a water-ice shell. It has a very thin atmosphere, composed primarily of oxygen. Its geologically young white-beige surface is striated by light tan cracks and streaks, with very few impact craters. In addition to Earth-bound telescope observations, Europa has been examined by a succession of space-probe flybys, the first occurring in the early 1970s. In September 2022, the Juno spacecraft flew within about 320 km (200 miles) of Europa for a more recent close-up view.\nEuropa has the smoothest surface of any known solid object in the Solar System. The apparent youth and smoothness of the surface is due to a water ocean beneath the surface, which could conceivably harbor extraterrestrial life. The predominant model suggests that heat from tidal flexing causes the ocean to remain liquid and drives ice movement similar to plate tectonics, absorbing chemicals from the surface into the ocean below. Sea salt from a subsurface ocean may be coating some geological features on Europa, suggesting that the ocean is interacting with the sea floor. This may be important in determining whether Europa could be habitable. In addition, the Hubble Space Telescope detected water vapor plumes similar to those observed on Saturn's moon Enceladus, which are thought to be caused by erupting cryogeysers. In May 2018, astronomers provided supporting evidence of water plume activity on Europa, based on an updated analysis of data obtained from the Galileo space probe, which orbited Jupiter from 1995 to 2003. Such plume activity could help researchers in a search for life from the subsurface Europan ocean without having to land on the moon. In March 2024, astronomers reported that the surface of Europa may have much less oxygen than previously inferred.\nEuropa was discovered independently by Simon Marius and Galileo Galilei. It was named (by Marius) after Europa, the Phoenician mother of King Minos of Crete and lover of Zeus (the Greek equivalent of the Roman god Jupiter).\nThe Galileo mission, launched in 1989, provides the bulk of current data on Europa. No spacecraft has yet landed on Europa, although there have been several proposed exploration missions. The European Space Agency's Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE) is a mission to Ganymede launched on 14 April 2023, that will include two flybys of Europa. NASA's Europa Clipper was launched on 14 October 2024.",

      "content": "Saturday Night Live (SNL) is an American late-night live sketch comedy variety show created by Lorne Michaels and developed by Michaels and Dick Ebersol that airs on NBC. The show's premiere was hosted by George Carlin on NBC on October 11, 1975, under the original title NBC's Saturday Night. The show's comedy sketches, which often parody popular culture and politics, are performed by a large and varying cast of repertory and newer cast members. Each episode is hosted by a celebrity guest, who usually delivers the opening monologue and performs in sketches with the cast, with featured performances by a musical guest. An episode normally begins with a cold open sketch that is usually based on current political events and ends with someone breaking character and proclaiming, \"Live from New York, it's Saturday Night!\", properly beginning the show.\nIn 1980, Michaels left the show to explore other opportunities. He was replaced by Jean Doumanian, who was then replaced by Ebersol after a season of bad reviews. Ebersol ran the show until 1985, when Michaels returned. Since then, Michaels has held the job of showrunner. Many SNL cast members have found national stardom while appearing on the show, and achieved success in film and television, both in front of and behind the camera. Others associated with the show, such as writers, have gone on to successful careers creating, writing, and starring in television and film.\nBroadcast from Studio 8H at NBC's headquarters in the Comcast Building at 30 Rockefeller Plaza, SNL has aired 988 episodes since its debut and began its 50th season on September 28, 2024, making it one of the longest-running network television programs in the United States. The show format has been developed and recreated in several countries, meeting with different levels of success. Successful sketches have seen life outside the show as feature films, including The Blues Brothers (1980), Wayne's World (1992) and A Night at the Roxbury (1998). The show has been marketed in other ways, including home media releases of \"best of\" and whole seasons, and books and documentaries about behind-the-scenes activities of running and developing the show.\nThroughout five decades on air, Saturday Night Live has received a vast number of awards, including 84 Primetime Emmy Awards, 6 Writers Guild of America Awards, and 3 Peabody Awards. In 2000, it was inducted into the National Association of Broadcasters Hall of Fame. It was ranked tenth in TV Guide's \"50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time\" list, and in 2007 it was listed as one of Time's \"100 Best TV Shows of All-TIME.\" As of 2022, the show had received more than 305 Primetime Emmy Award nominations, the most received by any television program. The live aspect of the show has resulted in several controversies and acts of censorship, with mistakes and intentional acts of sabotage by performers and guests.",

      "content": "Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a gas giant with a mass more than 2.5 times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined and slightly less than one-thousandth the mass of the Sun. Its diameter is 11 times that of Earth and a tenth that of the Sun. Jupiter orbits the Sun at a distance of 5.20 AU (778.5 Gm), with an orbital period of 11.86 years. It is the third-brightest natural object in the Earth's night sky, after the Moon and Venus, and has been observed since prehistoric times. Its name derives from that of Jupiter, the chief deity of ancient Roman religion.\nJupiter was the first of the Sun's planets to form, and its inward migration during the primordial phase of the Solar System affected much of the formation history of the other planets. Jupiter's atmosphere consists of 76% hydrogen and 24% helium by mass, with a denser interior. It contains trace elements and compounds like carbon, oxygen, sulfur, neon, ammonia, water vapour, phosphine, hydrogen sulfide, and hydrocarbons. Jupiter's helium abundance is 80% of the Sun's, similar to Saturn's composition.\nThe outer atmosphere is divided into a series of latitudinal bands, with turbulence and storms along their interacting boundaries; the most obvious result of this is the Great Red Spot, a giant storm that has been recorded since 1831. Because of its rapid rotation rate, one turn in ten hours, Jupiter is an oblate spheroid; it has a slight but noticeable 6.5% bulge around the equator compared to its poles. Its internal structure is believed to consist of an outer mantle of fluid metallic hydrogen and a diffuse inner core of denser material. The ongoing contraction of Jupiter's interior generates more heat than the planet receives from the Sun. Jupiter's magnetic field is the strongest and second-largest contiguous structure in the Solar System, generated by eddy currents within the fluid, metallic hydrogen core. The solar wind interacts with the magnetosphere, extending it outward and affecting Jupiter's orbit.\nAt least 97 moons orbit the planet; the four largest moons—Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto—orbit within the magnetosphere and are visible with common binoculars. Ganymede, the largest of the four, is larger than the planet Mercury. Jupiter is surrounded by a faint system of planetary rings. The rings of Jupiter consist mainly of dust and have three main segments: an inner torus of particles known as the halo, a relatively bright main ring, and an outer gossamer ring. The rings have a reddish colour in visible and near-infrared light. The age of the ring system is unknown, possibly dating back to Jupiter's formation. Since 1973, Jupiter has been visited by nine robotic probes: seven flybys and two dedicated orbiters, with two more en route. Jupiter-like exoplanets have also been found in other planetary systems.",

      "title": "White dwarf",
      "content": "A white dwarf is a stellar core remnant composed mostly of electron-degenerate matter. A white dwarf is very dense: in an Earth-sized volume, it packs a mass that is comparable to the Sun. No nuclear fusion takes place in a white dwarf; what light it radiates is from its residual heat. The nearest known white dwarf is Sirius B, at 8.6 light years, the smaller component of the Sirius binary star. There are currently thought to be eight white dwarfs among the one hundred star systems nearest the Sun. The unusual faintness of white dwarfs was first recognized in 1910. The name white dwarf was coined by Willem Jacob Luyten in 1922.\nWhite dwarfs are thought to be the final evolutionary state of stars whose mass is not high enough to become a neutron star or black hole. This includes over 97% of the stars in the Milky Way. After the hydrogen-fusing period of a main-sequence star of low or intermediate mass ends, such a star will expand to a red giant and fuse helium to carbon and oxygen in its core by the triple-alpha process. If a red giant has insufficient mass to generate the core temperatures required to fuse carbon (around 109 K), an inert mass of carbon and oxygen will build up at its center. After such a star sheds its outer layers and forms a planetary nebula, it will leave behind a core, which is the remnant white dwarf. Usually, white dwarfs are composed of carbon and oxygen (CO white dwarf). If the mass of the progenitor is between 7 and 9 solar masses (M☉), the core temperature will be sufficient to fuse carbon but not neon, in which case an oxygen–neon–magnesium (ONeMg or ONe) white dwarf may form. Stars of very low mass will be unable to fuse helium; hence, a helium white dwarf may be formed by mass loss in an interacting binary star system.\nBecause the material in a white dwarf no longer undergoes fusion reactions, it lacks a heat source to support it against gravitational collapse. Instead, it is supported only by electron degeneracy pressure, causing it to be extremely dense. The physics of degeneracy yields a maximum mass for a non-rotating white dwarf, the Chandrasekhar limit—  approximately 1.44 times M☉— beyond which electron degeneracy pressure cannot support it. A carbon–oxygen white dwarf which approaches this limit, typically by mass transfer from a companion star, may explode as a Type Ia supernova via a process known as carbon detonation; SN 1006 is a likely example.\nA white dwarf, very hot when it forms, gradually cools as it radiates its energy. This radiation, which initially has a high color temperature, lessens and reddens over time. Eventually, a white dwarf will cool enough that its material will begin to crystallize into a cold black dwarf. The oldest known white dwarfs still radiate at temperatures of a few thousand kelvins, which establishes an observational limit on the maximum possible age of the universe.",

A work of fiction is defined by the organization as a novella if it is between 17,500 and 40,000 words; awards are also given out for pieces of longer lengths in the novel category, and for shorter lengths in the short story and novelette categories. To be eligible for Nebula Award consideration, a novella must be published in English in the United States. Works published in English elsewhere in the world are also eligible, provided they are released on either a website or in an electronic edition. The Nebula Award for Best Novella has been awarded annually since 1966. Novellas published by themselves are eligible for the novel award instead, if the author requests them to be considered as such. The award has been described as one of \"the most important of the American science fiction awards\" and \"the science-fiction and fantasy equivalent\" of the Emmy Awards.\nNebula Award nominees and winners are selected by members of SFWA, although the authors of the nominees are not required to be members themselves. Each year, works are nominated by SFWA members during a period typically spanning from December 15 to January 31. The six works receiving the most nominations proceed to the final ballot, with additional nominees considered in the event of ties. Subsequently, members have about a month to vote on the final ballot, and the winners are announced at the Nebula Awards ceremony held in May. Authors are not permitted to nominate their own works, and ties in the final vote are broken, if possible, by the number of nominations the works received. The rules were changed to their current format in 2009. Previously, the eligibility period for nominations was defined as one year after the publication date of the work, which allowed the possibility for works to be nominated in the calendar year after their publication and then be awarded in the calendar year after that. Works were added to a preliminary list for the year if they had ten or more nominations, which were then voted on to create a final ballot, to which the SFWA organizing panel was also allowed to add an additional work.\nDuring the 60 nomination years, 206 authors have had works nominated; 57 of these have won, including co-authors and ties. Nancy Kress has won the most awards: four out of eight nominations. Robert Silverberg, John Varley, and Roger Zelazny have each won twice out of eight, two, and three nominations, respectively. Silverberg's and Kress's eight nominations are the most of any authors, followed by Lucius Shepard and Michael Bishop at seven, and Kate Wilhelm and Avram Davidson with six. Bishop has the most nominations without receiving an award for novellas, though Wilhelm and Davidson have also not won an award.",

A work of fiction is considered a novel by the organization if it is 40,000 words or longer; awards are also given out for pieces of shorter lengths, in the categories of short story, novelette, and novella. To be eligible for Nebula Award consideration, a novel must have been published in English in the US. Works published in English elsewhere in the world are also eligible, provided they are released on either a website or in an electronic edition. The award has been given annually since 1966.

      "content": "Astrobiology (also xenology or exobiology) is a scientific field within the life and environmental sciences that studies the origins, early evolution, distribution, and future of life in the universe by investigating its deterministic conditions and contingent events. As a discipline, astrobiology is founded on the premise that life may exist beyond Earth.\nResearch in astrobiology comprises three main areas: the study of habitable environments in the Solar System and beyond, the search for planetary biosignatures of past or present extraterrestrial life, and the study of the origin and early evolution of life on Earth.\nThe field of astrobiology has its origins in the 20th century with the advent of space exploration and the discovery of exoplanets. Early astrobiology research focused on the search for extraterrestrial life and the study of the potential for life to exist on other planets. In the 1960s and 1970s, NASA began its astrobiology pursuits within  the Viking program, which was the first US mission to land on Mars and search for signs of life. This mission, along with other early space exploration missions, laid the foundation for the development of astrobiology as a discipline.\nRegarding habitable environments, astrobiology investigates potential locations beyond Earth that could support life, such as Mars, Europa, and exoplanets, through research into the extremophiles populating austere environments on Earth, like volcanic and deep sea environments. Research within this topic is conducted utilising the methodology of the geosciences, especially geobiology, for astrobiological applications.\nThe search for biosignatures involves the identification of signs of past or present life in the form of organic compounds, isotopic ratios, or microbial fossils. Research within this topic is conducted utilising the methodology of planetary and environmental science, especially atmospheric science, for astrobiological applications, and is often conducted through remote sensing and in situ missions.\nAstrobiology also concerns the study of the origin and early evolution of life on Earth to try to understand the conditions that are necessary for life to form on other planets. This research seeks to understand how life emerged from non-living matter and how it evolved to become the diverse array of organisms we see today. Research within this topic is conducted utilising the methodology of paleosciences, especially paleobiology, for astrobiological applications.\nAstrobiology is a rapidly developing field with a strong interdisciplinary aspect that holds many challenges and opportunities for scientists. Astrobiology programs and research centres are present in many universities and research institutions around the world, and space agencies like NASA and ESA have dedicated departments and programs for astrobiology research.",

      "content": "Ganymede is an open source network directory management framework, designed to allow administrator teams to collaboratively manage subsets of an organization's directory services, such as NIS, DNS, Active Directory / LDAP, DHCP, and RADIUS, among others.  First announced and released at the 1998 USENIX LISA conference, Ganymede has been under public development and use since then.\nGanymede uses a central server which supports clients connecting via Java RMI. The Ganymede server maintains a transactional object graph database of network information such as user objects, group objects, system objects, network objects, etc.  Users and administrators run Ganymede clients (GUI or XML based) to create, modify, or delete objects in the database. Whenever a user commits a transaction, the Ganymede server schedules a number of background threads to write out updated network source files and run whatever system scripts are required to propagate the new data into the managed network directory services. If multiple users are working concurrently, the scheduler makes sure that the entire network environment is updated with transactionally consistent directory images as builds finish and new ones are issued.\nThe Ganymede server is meant to be programmed by the adopter, who can define arbitrary object data types along with custom logic to interact with the user through the GUI and to maintain consistency within and between objects. Adopters can also create custom tasks which can be executed at specified times by the internal Ganymede scheduler. Such custom tasks can make changes in the server's object database and/or can run external scripts to update external services.\nGanymede has an elaborate XML data format which can be used to import and export the server's object database schema and object data. Importing XML will typically result in the creation, modification, or deletion of database objects, and will trigger one or more network directory service rebuilds just as using the GUI client would do.\nAbove all, Ganymede is designed around administration teams.  Administrators are members of 'Owner Groups', which own objects.  Any object that is changed by a user or an automated task can result in change report email being sent to administrators in the appropriate Owner Group, making it possible for admins to keep up to date with changes that others in their groups are making. Owner Groups can be granted authority over arbitrary subsets of the object database, making it easy to slice up the network directory space in any fashion that may be desired.\nAs a programmable framework, Ganymede must be programmed for a specific set of directory management tasks. Fundamental Generic Networking in Germany has used it as the basis of their Doctor DNS project, which is being used to manage DNS for the Kaiserslautern University of Technology.",

      "content": "The multiverse is the hypothetical set of all universes. Together, these universes are presumed to comprise everything that exists: the entirety of space, time, matter, energy, information, and the physical laws and constants that describe them. The different universes within the multiverse are called \"parallel universes\", \"flat universes\", \"other universes\", \"alternate universes\", \"multiple universes\", \"plane universes\", \"parent and child universes\", \"many universes\", or \"many worlds\". One common assumption is that the multiverse is a \"patchwork quilt of separate universes all bound by the same laws of physics.\"\nThe concept of multiple universes, or a multiverse, has been discussed throughout history. It has evolved and has been debated in various fields, including cosmology, physics, and philosophy. Some physicists have argued that the multiverse is a philosophical notion rather than a scientific hypothesis, as it cannot be empirically falsified. In recent years, there have been proponents and skeptics of multiverse theories within the physics community. Although some scientists have analyzed data in search of evidence for other universes, no statistically significant evidence has been found. Critics argue that the multiverse concept lacks testability and falsifiability, which are essential for scientific inquiry, and that it raises unresolved metaphysical issues.\nMax Tegmark and Brian Greene have proposed different classification schemes for multiverses and universes. Tegmark's four-level classification consists of Level I: an extension of our universe, Level II: universes with different physical constants, Level III: many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, and Level IV: ultimate ensemble. Brian Greene's nine types of multiverses include quilted, inflationary, brane, cyclic, landscape, quantum, holographic, simulated, and ultimate. The ideas explore various dimensions of space, physical laws, and mathematical structures to explain the existence and interactions of multiple universes. Some other multiverse concepts include twin-world models, cyclic theories, M-theory, and black-hole cosmology.\nThe anthropic principle suggests that the existence of a multitude of universes, each with different physical laws, could explain the asserted appearance of fine-tuning of our own universe for conscious life. The weak anthropic principle posits that we exist in one of the few universes that support life. Debates around Occam's razor and the simplicity of the multiverse versus a single universe arise, with proponents like Max Tegmark arguing that the multiverse is simpler and more elegant. The many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics and modal realism, the belief that all possible worlds exist and are as real as our world, are also subjects of debate in the context of the anthropic principle.",

He ascended the throne on 29 August 1911, at the age of 25 and ruled the State of Hyderabad between until 1948, when the Indian Union annexed it. He was styled as His Exalted Highness (H.E.H) the Nizam of Hyderabad, and was widely considered one of the world's wealthiest people of all time. With some estimates placing his wealth at 2% of U.S. GDP, his portrait was on the cover of Time magazine in 1937. As a semi-autonomous monarch, he had his mint, printing his currency, the Hyderabadi rupee, and had a private treasury that was said to contain £100 million in gold and silver bullion, and a further £400 million of jewels (in 2008 terms). The major source of his wealth was the Golconda mines, the only supplier of diamonds in the world at that time. Among them was the Jacob Diamond, valued at some £50 million (in 2008 terms), and used by the Nizam as a paperweight.\nDuring his 37-year rule, electricity was introduced, and railways, roads, and airports were developed. He was known as the \"Architect of modern Hyderabad\" and is credited with establishing many public institutions in the city of Hyderabad, including Osmania University, Osmania General Hospital, State Bank of Hyderabad, Begumpet Airport, and the Hyderabad High Court. Two reservoirs, Osman Sagar and Himayat Sagar, were built during his reign, to prevent another great flood in the city. The Nizam also constructed the Nizam Sagar Dam and, in 1923, a reservoir was constructed across the Manjira River, a tributary of the Godavari River, between Achampet (Nizamabad) and Banjepally villages of Kamareddy district in Telangana, India. It is located at about 144 km (89 mi) northwest of Hyderabad and is the oldest dam in the state.\nThe Nizam had refused to accede Hyderabad to India after the country's independence on 15 August 1947. He wanted his domains to remain an independent state or join Pakistan. Later, he wanted his state to join India; however, his power had weakened because of the Telangana Rebellion and the rise of a radical militia known as the Razakars, whom he could not put down. In 1948, the Indian Army invaded and annexed Hyderabad State and defeated the Razakars. The Nizam became the Rajpramukh of Hyderabad State between 1950 and 1956, after which the state was partitioned and became part of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and Maharashtra.\nIn 1951, he started the construction of Nizam Orthopedic Hospital (now known as Nizam's Institute of Medical Sciences (NIMS)) and leased it to the government for 99 years for a monthly rent of Rs.1. He also donated 14,000 acres (5,700 ha) of land from his estate to Vinobha Bhave's Bhoodan movement for re-distribution among landless farmers.",

      "content": "Mother, officially localized as EarthBound Beginnings, is a 1989 role-playing video game developed by Ape Inc. and Nintendo and published by Nintendo for the Family Computer. It is the first entry in the Mother series and was first released in Japan on July 27, 1989. The game was re-released in Japan along with its sequel on the single-cartridge compilation Mother 1+2 for the Game Boy Advance in 2003. The game follows a young American boy named Ninten as he uses his great-grandfather's studies on psychic powers to put an end to the paranormal phenomena spiraling the country into disarray.\nWriter and director Shigesato Itoi pitched Mother's concept to Shigeru Miyamoto while visiting Nintendo's headquarters for other business. Though Miyamoto rejected the proposal at first, he eventually gave Itoi a development team. Modeled after the gameplay of the Dragon Quest series, Mother subverted its fantasy genre contemporaries by being set in an offbeat parody of the late 20th-century United States. Itoi sought to incorporate standard RPG staples within the framework of a modern-day setting, parodying Western culture and Americana. As such, throughout the game, players use medication and hospitals to restore their health, utilize baseball bats and toy guns to fight enemies, and encounter aliens, robots, possessed objects, and brainwashed animals and humans. Mother uses random encounters to enter a menu-based, first-person perspective battle system.\nMother sold around 400,000 copies upon its release, where it was praised for its similarities to the Dragon Quest series and its simultaneous parody of the genre's tropes, though its high difficulty level and balance issues polarized critics. A North American localization of Mother was completed and slated for release as Earth Bound, but was abandoned as being commercially nonviable. A finished prototype was later found and publicly circulated on the Internet under the informal title EarthBound Zero. Though many critics considered Mother's sequel to be similar and an overall better implementation of its gameplay ideas, Jeremy Parish of 1UP.com wrote that Mother importantly generated interest in video game emulation and the historical preservation of unreleased games.\nIn 1994, Mother's sequel, Mother 2: Gīgu no Gyakushū, was released in Japan for the Super Famicom, which was localized and released in America in 1995 under the name \"EarthBound\". EarthBound initially flopped in the U.S., but later gained a cult following. EarthBound was followed by the Japan-only sequel Mother 3 for the Game Boy Advance in 2006. To commemorate the 20th anniversary of EarthBound's U.S. release, Mother was released globally as EarthBound Beginnings for the Wii U Virtual Console in June 2015, and was released alongside EarthBound for the Nintendo Classics service in February 2022.",

      "content": "The Spitzer Space Telescope, formerly the Space Infrared Telescope Facility (SIRTF), was an infrared space telescope launched in 2003, that was deactivated when operations ended on 30 January 2020. Spitzer was the third space telescope dedicated to infrared astronomy, following IRAS (1983) and ISO (1995–1998). It was the first spacecraft to use an Earth-trailing orbit, later used by the Kepler planet-finder.\nThe planned mission period was to be 2.5 years with a pre-launch expectation that the mission could extend to five or slightly more years until the onboard liquid helium supply was exhausted. This occurred on 15 May 2009. Without liquid helium to cool the telescope to the very low temperatures needed to operate, most of the instruments were no longer usable. However, the two shortest-wavelength modules of the IRAC camera continued to operate with the same sensitivity as before the helium was exhausted, and continued to be used into early 2020 in the Spitzer Warm Mission.\nDuring the warm mission, the two short wavelength channels of IRAC operated at 28.7 K and were predicted to experience little to no degradation at this temperature compared to the nominal mission. The Spitzer data, from both the primary and warm phases, are archived at the Infrared Science Archive (IRSA).\nIn keeping with NASA tradition, the telescope was renamed after its successful demonstration of operation, on 18 December 2003. Unlike most telescopes that are named by a board of scientists, typically after famous deceased astronomers, the new name for SIRTF was obtained from a contest open to the general public.\nThe contest led to the telescope being named in honor of astronomer Lyman Spitzer, who had promoted the concept of space telescopes in the 1940s. Spitzer wrote a 1946 report for RAND Corporation describing the advantages of an extraterrestrial observatory and how it could be realized with available or upcoming technology. He has been cited for his pioneering contributions to rocketry and astronomy, as well as \"his vision and leadership in articulating the advantages and benefits to be realized from the Space Telescope Program.\"\nThe US$776 million Spitzer was launched on 25 August 2003 at 05:35:39 UTC from Cape Canaveral SLC-17B aboard a Delta II 7920H rocket. It was placed into a heliocentric (as opposed to a geocentric) orbit trailing and drifting away from Earth's orbit at approximately 0.1 astronomical units per year (an \"Earth-trailing\" orbit).\nThe primary mirror is 85 centimeters (33 in) in diameter, f/12, made of beryllium and was cooled to 5.5 K (−268 °C; −450 °F). The satellite contains three instruments that allowed it to perform astronomical imaging and photometry from 3.6 to 160 micrometers, spectroscopy from 5.2 to 38 micrometers, and spectrophotometry from 55 to 95 micrometers.",

      "title": "Big Bang",
      "content": "The Big Bang is a physical theory that describes how the universe expanded from an initial state of high density and temperature. Various cosmological models based on the Big Bang concept explain a broad range of phenomena,  including the abundance of light elements, the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, and large-scale structure. The uniformity of the universe, known as the horizon and flatness problems, is explained through cosmic inflation: a phase of accelerated expansion during the earliest stages. Detailed measurements of the expansion rate of the universe place the Big Bang singularity at an estimated 13.787±0.02 billion years ago, which is considered the age of the universe. A wide range of empirical evidence strongly favors the Big Bang event, which is now widely accepted.\nExtrapolating this cosmic expansion backward in time using the known laws of physics, the models describe an extraordinarily hot and dense primordial universe. Physics lacks a widely accepted theory that can model the earliest conditions of the Big Bang. As the universe expanded, it cooled sufficiently to allow the formation of subatomic particles, and later atoms. These primordial elements—mostly hydrogen, with some helium and lithium—then coalesced under the force of gravity aided by dark matter, forming early stars and galaxies.  Measurements of the redshifts of supernovae indicate that the expansion of the universe is accelerating, an observation attributed to a concept called dark energy.\nThe concept of an expanding universe was introduced by the physicist Alexander Friedmann in 1922 with the mathematical derivation of the Friedmann equations. The earliest empirical observation of an expanding universe is known as Hubble's law, published in work by physicist Edwin Hubble in 1929, which discerned that galaxies are moving away from Earth at a rate that accelerates proportionally with distance. Independent of Friedmann's work, and independent of Hubble's observations, in 1931 physicist Georges Lemaître proposed that the universe emerged from a \"primeval atom,\" introducing the modern notion of the Big Bang. In 1964, the CMB was discovered. Over the next few years measurements showed this radiation to be uniform over directions in the sky and the shape of the energy versus intensity curve, both consistent with the Big Bang models of high temperatures and densities in the distant past.  By the late 1960s most cosmologists were convinced that competing steady-state model of cosmic evolution was incorrect.\nThere remain aspects of the observed universe that are not yet adequately explained by the Big Bang models. These include the unequal abundances of matter and antimatter known as baryon asymmetry, the detailed nature of dark matter surrounding galaxies, and the origin of dark energy.",

Mir was the first modular space station and was assembled in orbit from 1986 to 1996. It had a greater mass than any previous spacecraft. At the time it was the largest artificial satellite in orbit, succeeded by the International Space Station (ISS) after Mir's orbit decayed. The station served as a microgravity research laboratory in which crews conducted experiments in biology, human biology, physics, astronomy, meteorology, and spacecraft systems with a goal of developing technologies required for permanent occupation of space.\nMir was the first continuously inhabited long-term research station in orbit and held the record for the longest continuous human presence in space at 3,644 days, until it was surpassed by the ISS on 23 October 2010. It holds the record for the longest single human spaceflight, with Valeri Polyakov spending 437 days and 18 hours on the station between 1994 and 1995. Mir was occupied for a total of twelve and a half years out of its fifteen-year lifespan, having the capacity to support a resident crew of three, or larger crews for short visits.\nFollowing the success of the Salyut programme, Mir represented the next stage in the Soviet Union's space station programme. The first module of the station, known as the core module or base block, was launched in 1986 and followed by six further modules. Proton rockets were used to launch all of its components except for the docking module, which was installed by US Space Shuttle mission STS-74 in 1995. When complete, the station consisted of seven pressurised modules and several unpressurised components. Power was provided by several photovoltaic arrays attached directly to the modules. The station was maintained at an orbit between 296 and 421 km (184 and 262 mi) altitude and travelled at an average speed of 27,700 km/h (17,200 mph), completing 15.7 orbits per day.\nThe station was launched as part of the Soviet Union's crewed spaceflight programme effort to maintain a long-term research outpost in space, and following the collapse of the USSR, was operated by the new Russian Federal Space Agency (RKA). As a result, most of the station's occupants were Soviet; through international collaborations such as the Interkosmos, Euromir and Shuttle–Mir programmes, the station was made accessible to space travellers from several Asian, European and North American nations. Mir was deorbited in March 2001 after funding was cut off. The cost of the Mir programme was estimated by former RKA General Director Yuri Koptev in 2001 as $4.2 billion over its lifetime (including development, assembly and orbital operation).",

      "content": "A satellite telephone, satellite phone or satphone is a type of mobile phone that connects to other phones or the telephone network by radio link through satellites orbiting the Earth instead of terrestrial cell sites, as cellphones do. Therefore, they can work in most geographic locations on the Earth's surface, as long as open sky and the line-of-sight between the phone and the satellite are provided. Depending on the architecture of a particular system, coverage may include the entire Earth or only specific regions. Satellite phones provide similar functionality to terrestrial mobile telephones; voice calling, text messaging, and low-bandwidth Internet access are supported through most systems. The advantage of a satellite phone is that it can be used in such regions where local terrestrial communication infrastructures, such as landline and cellular networks, are not available.\nSatellite phones are popular on expeditions into remote locations where there is no reliable cellular service, such as recreational hiking, hunting, fishing, and boating trips, as well as for business purposes, such as mining locations and maritime shipping. Satellite phones rarely get disrupted by natural disasters on Earth or human actions such as war, so they have proven to be dependable communication tools in emergency and humanitarian situations, when the local communications system have been compromised.\nThe mobile equipment, also known as a terminal, varies widely. Early satellite phone handsets had a size and weight comparable to that of a late-1980s or early-1990s mobile phone, but usually with a large retractable antenna. More recent satellite phones are similar in size to a regular mobile phone while some prototype satellite phones have no distinguishable difference from an ordinary smartphone.\nA fixed installation such as one used aboard a ship may include large, rugged, rack-mounted electronics, and a steerable microwave antenna on the mast that automatically tracks the overhead satellites. Smaller installations using VoIP over a two-way satellite broadband service such as BGAN or VSAT bring the costs within the reach of leisure vessel owners. Internet service satellite phones have notoriously poor reception indoors, though it may be possible to get a consistent signal near a window or in the top floor of a building if the roof is sufficiently thin. The phones have connectors for external antennas that can be installed in vehicles and buildings. The systems also allow for the use of repeaters, much like terrestrial mobile phone systems.\nIn the early 2020s various manufacturers began to integrate satellite messaging connectivity and satellite emergency services into conventional mobile phones for use in remote regions, where there is no reliable terrestrial network.",

      "content": "María Eva Duarte de Perón (Spanish pronunciation: [maˈɾi.a ˈeβa ˈðwarte ðe peˈɾon]; née María Eva Duarte; 7 May 1919 – 26 July 1952), better known as Eva Perón or by the nickname Evita (Spanish: [eˈβita]), was an Argentine politician, activist, actress, and philanthropist who served as First Lady of Argentina from June 1946 until her death in July 1952, as the wife of Argentine President Juan Perón. She was born in poverty in the rural village of Los Toldos, in the Pampas, as the youngest of five children. In 1934, at the age of 15, she moved to the nation's capital of Buenos Aires to pursue a career as a stage, radio, and film actress. She married Perón in 1945, when he was still an army colonel, and was propelled onto the political stage when he became President in 1946. She became a central figure of Peronism and Argentine culture because of the Eva Perón Foundation, a charitable organization perceived by many Argentinians as highly impactful.\nShe met Colonel Juan Perón on 22 January 1944 during a charity event at the Luna Park Stadium to benefit the victims of an earthquake in San Juan, Argentina. The two were married the following year. Juan Perón was elected President of Argentina in June 1946; during the next six years, Eva Perón became powerful within the pro-Peronist trade unions, primarily for speaking on behalf of labor rights. She also ran the Ministries of Labor and Health, founded and ran the charitable Eva Perón Foundation, championed women's suffrage in Argentina, and founded and ran the nation's first large-scale female political party, the Female Peronist Party.\nIn 1951, Eva Perón announced her candidacy for the Peronist nomination for the office of Vice President of Argentina, receiving great support from the Peronist political base, low-income and working-class Argentines who were referred to as descamisados or \"shirtless ones\" (similar to the term “sans-culottes” during the French Revolution). Opposition from the nation's military and bourgeoisie, coupled with her declining health, ultimately forced her to withdraw her candidacy. In 1952, shortly before her death from cancer at 33, Eva Perón was given the title of \"Spiritual Leader of the Nation of Argentina\" by the Argentine Congress. She was given a state funeral upon her death, a prerogative generally reserved for heads of state.\nEva Perón has become a part of international popular culture, most famously as the subject of the musical Evita (1976).  Cristina Álvarez Rodríguez has said that Eva Perón has never left the collective consciousness of Argentines. Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, the second female president of Argentina (after Juan Perón's third wife Isabel Perón), claims that women of her generation owe a debt to Eva Perón for \"her example of passion and combativeness\".",

      "content": "RMS Titanic was a British ocean liner that sank in the early hours of 15 April 1912 as a result of striking an iceberg on her maiden voyage from Southampton, England, to New York City, United States. Of the estimated 2,224 passengers and crew aboard, approximately 1,500 died (estimates vary), making the incident one of the deadliest peacetime sinkings of a single ship. Titanic, operated by White Star Line, carried some of the wealthiest people in the world, as well as hundreds of emigrants from the British Isles, Scandinavia, and elsewhere in Europe who were seeking a new life in the United States and Canada. The disaster drew public attention, spurred major changes in maritime safety regulations, and inspired a lasting legacy in popular culture. It was the second time White Star Line had lost a ship on her maiden voyage, the first being RMS Tayleur in 1854.\nTitanic was the largest ship afloat upon entering service and the second of three Olympic-class ocean liners built for White Star Line. The ship was built by the Harland and Wolff shipbuilding company in Belfast. Thomas Andrews Jr., the chief naval architect of the shipyard, died in the disaster. Titanic was under the command of Captain Edward John Smith, who went down with the ship. J. Bruce Ismay, White Star Line's chairman, managed to get into a lifeboat and survived.\nThe first-class accommodations were designed to be the pinnacle of comfort and luxury. They included a gymnasium, swimming pool, smoking rooms, fine restaurants and cafes, a Victorian-style Turkish bath, and hundreds of opulent cabins. A high-powered radiotelegraph transmitter was available to send passenger \"marconigrams\" and for the ship's operational use. Titanic had advanced safety features, such as watertight compartments and remotely activated watertight doors, which contributed to the ship's reputation as \"unsinkable\".\nTitanic was equipped with sixteen lifeboat davits, each capable of lowering three lifeboats, for a total capacity of 48 boats. Despite this capacity, the ship was scantly equipped with a total of only twenty lifeboats. Fourteen of these were regular lifeboats, two were cutter lifeboats, and four were collapsible and proved difficult to launch while the ship was sinking. Together, the lifeboats could hold 1,178 people — roughly half the number of passengers on board, and a third of the number of passengers the ship could have carried at full capacity (a number consistent with the maritime safety regulations of the era). The British Board of Trade's regulations required fourteen lifeboats for a ship of 10,000 tonnes. Titanic carried six more than required, allowing 338 extra people room in lifeboats. When the ship sank, the lifeboats that had been lowered were only filled up to an average of 60%.",

      "content": "The Nebula Award for Best Novelette is given each year by the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers Association (SFWA) to a science fiction or fantasy novelette. A work of fiction is defined by the organization as a novelette if it is between 7,500 and 17,500 words; awards are also given out for pieces of longer lengths in the Novel and Novella categories, and for shorter lengths in the Short Story category. To be eligible for Nebula Award consideration a novelette must be published in English in the United States. Works published in English elsewhere in the world are also eligible provided they are released on either a website or in an electronic edition. The Nebula Award for Best Novelette has been awarded annually since 1966. The Nebula Awards have been described as one of \"the most important of the American science fiction awards\" and \"the science-fiction and fantasy equivalent\" of the Emmy Awards.\nNebula Award nominees and winners are chosen by members of SFWA, though the authors of the nominees do not need to be members. Works are nominated each year by members in a period around December 15 through January 31, and the six works that receive the most nominations then form the final ballot, with additional nominees possible in the case of ties. Soon after, members are given a month to vote on the ballot, and the final results are presented at the Nebula Awards ceremony in May. Authors are not permitted to nominate their own works, and ties in the final vote are broken, if possible, by the number of nominations the works received. The rules were changed to their current format in 2009. Previously, the eligibility period for nominations was defined as one year after the publication date of the work, which allowed the possibility for works to be nominated in the calendar year after their publication and then be awarded in the calendar year after that. Works were added to a preliminary list for the year if they had ten or more nominations, which were then voted on to create a final ballot, to which the SFWA organizing panel was also allowed to add an additional work.\nDuring the 60 nomination years, 240 authors have had works nominated; 52 of these have won, including co-authors and ties. Ted Chiang has won three times out of three nominations, and Poul Anderson, Kelly Link, George R. R. Martin, Sarah Pinsker, and Connie Willis have each won twice out of five, two, four, six, and five nominations, respectively. One of Anderson's nominations was under the pseudonym Michael Karageorge. Ursula K. Le Guin has the most nominations of any author with seven, including one win and not including one withdrawn nomination. James Patrick Kelly and Richard Bowes are tied for the most nominations without winning at six.",

      "title": "Oort cloud",
      "content": "The Oort cloud (pronounced  AWT or  OORT), sometimes called the Öpik–Oort cloud, is theorized to be a cloud of billions of icy planetesimals surrounding the Sun at distances ranging from 2,000 to 200,000 AU (0.03 to 3.2 light-years). The cloud was proposed in 1950 by the Dutch astronomer Jan Oort, in whose honor the idea was named. Oort proposed that the bodies in this cloud replenish and keep constant the number of long-period comets entering the inner Solar System—where they are eventually consumed and destroyed during close approaches to the Sun.\nThe cloud is thought to encompass two regions: a disc-shaped inner Oort cloud aligned with the solar ecliptic (also called its Hills cloud) and a spherical outer Oort cloud enclosing the entire Solar System. Both regions lie well beyond the heliosphere and are in interstellar space. The innermost portion of the Oort cloud is more than a thousand times farther from the Sun than the Kuiper belt, the scattered disc and the detached objects—three nearer reservoirs of trans-Neptunian objects.\nThe outer limit of the Oort cloud defines the cosmographic boundary of the Solar System. This area is defined by the Sun's Hill sphere, and hence lies at the interface between solar and galactic gravitational dominion. The outer Oort cloud is only loosely bound to the Solar System and its constituents are easily affected by the gravitational pulls of passing stars, the Milky Way itself and the cloud's own microgravity. These forces served to moderate and render more circular the highly eccentric orbits of material ejected from the inner Solar System during its early phases of development. The circular orbits of material in the Oort disc are largely thanks to this galactic gravitational torquing. By the same token, galactic interference in the motion of Oort bodies occasionally dislodges comets from their orbits within the cloud, sending them into the inner Solar System. Based on their orbits, most but not all of the short-period comets appear to have come from the Oort disc. Other short-period comets may have originated from the far larger spherical cloud.\nAstronomers hypothesize that the material presently in the Oort cloud formed much closer to the Sun, in the protoplanetary disc, and was then scattered far into space through the gravitational influence of the giant planets. No direct observation of the Oort cloud is possible with present imaging technology. Nevertheless, the cloud is thought to be the source that replenishes most long-period and Halley-type comets, which are eventually consumed by their close approaches to the Sun after entering the inner Solar System. The cloud may also serve the same function for many of the centaurs and Jupiter-family comets.",

      "title": "Titanic (1997 film)",
      "content": "Titanic is a 1997 American epic romantic disaster film written and directed by James Cameron. Incorporating both historical and fictionalized aspects, it is based on accounts of the sinking of RMS Titanic in 1912. The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet as members of different social classes who fall in love during the ship's maiden voyage. The film also features an ensemble cast of Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher, Bernard Hill, Jonathan Hyde, Danny Nucci, David Warner, and Bill Paxton.\nCameron's inspiration for the film came from his fascination with shipwrecks. He felt a love story interspersed with human loss would be essential to convey the emotional impact of the disaster. Production began on September 1, 1995, when Cameron shot footage of the Titanic wreck. The modern scenes on the research vessel were shot on board the Akademik Mstislav Keldysh, which Cameron had used as a base when filming the wreck. Scale models, computer-generated imagery, and a reconstruction of the Titanic built at Baja Studios were used to recreate the sinking. The film was initially in development at 20th Century Fox, but a mounting budget and being behind schedule resulted in Fox asking Paramount Pictures for financial help; Paramount handled distribution in the United States and Canada, while Fox released the film in other territories. Titanic was the most expensive film ever made at the time, with a production budget of $200 million. Filming took place from July 1996 to March 1997.\nTitanic premiered at the Tokyo International Film Festival on November 1, 1997, and was released in the United States on December 19. It was praised for its visual effects, performances (particularly those of DiCaprio, Winslet, and Gloria Stuart), production values, direction, score, cinematography, story, and emotional depth. Among other awards, it was nominated for 14 Academy Awards and won a record-tying 11, including Best Picture and Best Director, tying Ben-Hur (1959) for the most Academy Awards won by a film. With an initial worldwide gross of over $1.84 billion, Titanic was the first film to reach the billion-dollar mark. It was the highest-grossing film of all time until Cameron's next film, Avatar (2009), surpassed it in 2010. Income from the initial theatrical release, retail video, and soundtrack sales and US broadcast rights exceeded $3.2 billion. A number of re-releases have pushed the film's worldwide theatrical total to $2.264 billion, making it the second film to gross more than $2 billion worldwide after Avatar. The Library of Congress selected it for preservation in the United States National Film Registry for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" in 2017.",

      "content": "Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. It is a gaseous cyan-coloured ice giant. Most of the planet is made of water, ammonia, and methane in a supercritical phase of matter, which astronomy calls \"ice\" or volatiles. The planet's atmosphere has a complex layered cloud structure and has the lowest minimum temperature (49 K (−224 °C; −371 °F)) of all the Solar System's planets. It has a marked axial tilt of 82.23°  with a retrograde rotation period of 17 hours and 14 minutes. This means that in an 84-Earth-year orbital period around the Sun, its poles get around 42 years of continuous sunlight, followed by 42 years of continuous darkness.\nUranus has the third-largest diameter and fourth-largest mass among the Solar System's planets. Based on current models, inside its volatile mantle layer is a rocky core, and surrounding it is a thick hydrogen and helium atmosphere. Trace amounts of hydrocarbons (thought to be produced via hydrolysis) and carbon monoxide along with carbon dioxide (thought to have originated from comets) have been detected in the upper atmosphere. There are many unexplained climate phenomena in Uranus's atmosphere, such as its peak wind speed of 900 km/h (560 mph), variations in its polar cap, and its erratic cloud formation. The planet also has very low internal heat compared to other giant planets, the cause of which remains unclear.\nLike the other giant planets, Uranus has a ring system, a magnetosphere, and many natural satellites. The extremely dark ring system reflects only about 2% of the incoming light. Uranus's 28 natural satellites include 18 known regular moons, of which 13 are small inner moons. Further out are the larger five major moons of the planet: Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, and Oberon. Orbiting at a much greater distance from Uranus are the ten known irregular moons. The planet's magnetosphere is highly asymmetric and has many charged particles, which may be the cause of the darkening of its rings and moons.\nUranus is visible to the naked eye, but it is very dim and was not classified as a planet until 1781, when it was first observed by William Herschel. About seven decades after its discovery, consensus was reached that the planet be named after the Greek god Uranus (Ouranos), one of the Greek primordial deities. As of 2025, it has been visited only once when in 1986 the Voyager 2 probe flew by the planet. Though nowadays it can be resolved and observed by telescopes, there is much desire to revisit the planet, as shown by Planetary Science Decadal Survey's decision to make the proposed Uranus Orbiter and Probe mission a top priority in the 2023–2032 survey, and the CNSA's proposal to fly by the planet with a subprobe of Tianwen-4.",

The American space manufacturer SpaceX began providing service in 2020, using Crew Dragon, and NASA plans to add Boeing when Starliner becomes operational no earlier than 2026. NASA has contracted for six operational missions from Boeing and fourteen from SpaceX, ensuring sufficient support for ISS through 2030.\nThe spacecraft are owned and operated by the vendor, and crew transportation is provided to NASA as a commercial service. Each mission sends up to four astronauts to the ISS. Operational flights occur approximately once every six months for missions that last for approximately six months. A spacecraft remains docked to the ISS during its mission, and missions usually overlap by at least a few days. Between the retirement of the Space Shuttle in 2011 and the first operational CCP mission in 2020, NASA relied on the Soyuz program to transport its astronauts to the ISS.\nA Crew Dragon spacecraft is launched to space atop a Falcon 9 Block 5 launch vehicle and the capsule returns to Earth via splashdown in the ocean near Florida. The program's first operational mission, SpaceX Crew-1, launched on 16 November 2020. Boeing Starliner spacecraft will participate after its final test flight, launched atop an Atlas V N22 launch vehicle. Instead of a splashdown, a Starliner capsule will return on land with airbags at one of four designated sites in the western United States.\nDevelopment of the Commercial Crew Program began in 2011 as NASA shifted from internal development of crewed vehicles to perform ISS crew rotation to commercial industry development of transport to the ISS. A series of open competitions over the following two years saw successful bids from Boeing, Blue Origin, Sierra Nevada, and SpaceX to develop proposals for ISS crew transport vehicles. In 2014, NASA awarded separate fixed-price contracts to Boeing and SpaceX to develop their respective systems and to fly astronauts to the ISS. Each contract required four successful demonstrations to achieve human rating for the system: pad abort, uncrewed orbital test, launch abort, and crewed orbital test. Operational missions were initially planned to begin in 2017, with missions alternating between the two providers. Delays required NASA to purchase additional seats on Soyuz spacecraft up to Soyuz MS-17 until Crew Dragon missions commenced in 2020. Crew Dragon continues to handle all missions until Starliner becomes operational no earlier than 2026.",

      "title": "Black hole information paradox",
      "content": "The black hole information paradox is a paradox that appears when the predictions of quantum mechanics and general relativity are combined. The theory of general relativity predicts the existence of black holes that are regions of spacetime from which nothing—not even light—can escape. In the 1970s, Stephen Hawking applied the semiclassical approach of quantum field theory in curved spacetime to such systems and found that an isolated black hole would emit a form of radiation (now called Hawking radiation in his honor). He also argued that the detailed form of the radiation would be independent of the initial state of the black hole, and depend only on its mass, electric charge and angular momentum.\nThe information paradox appears when one considers a process in which a black hole is formed through a physical process and then evaporates away entirely through Hawking radiation. Hawking's calculation suggests that the final state of radiation would retain information only about the total mass, electric charge and angular momentum of the initial state. Since many different states can have the same mass, charge and angular momentum, this suggests that many initial physical states could evolve into the same final state. Therefore, information about the details of the initial state would be permanently lost; however, this violates a core precept of both classical and quantum physics: that, in principle only, the state of a system at one point in time should determine its state at any other time. Specifically, in quantum mechanics the state of the system is encoded by its wave function. The evolution of the wave function is determined by a unitary operator, and unitarity implies that the wave function at any instant of time can be used to determine the wave function either in the past or the future. In 1993, Don Page argued that if a black hole starts in a pure quantum state and evaporates completely by a unitary process, the von Neumann entropy of the Hawking radiation initially increases and then decreases back to zero when the black hole has disappeared. This is called the Page curve.\nIt is now generally believed that information is preserved in black-hole evaporation. For many researchers, deriving the Page curve is synonymous with solving the black hole information puzzle. But views differ as to precisely how Hawking's original semiclassical calculation should be corrected. In recent years, several extensions of the original paradox have been explored. Taken together, these puzzles about black hole evaporation have implications for how gravity and quantum mechanics must be combined. The information paradox remains an active field of research in quantum gravity.",

In the past, Ion had acquired first-run airings of Canadian series not picked up by other American networks and had also been infamous for devoting much of its schedule to infomercials. Under Scripps ownership, Ion has increasingly added national sports programming from the newly established Scripps Sports division, beginning with packages of Women's National Basketball Association basketball and National Women's Soccer League soccer.\nIon is available throughout most of the United States through its group of 44 owned-and-operated stations and 20 network affiliates, as well as through distribution on pay-TV providers and streaming services; since 2014, the network has also increased affiliate distribution in several markets through the digital subchannels of local television stations owned by companies such as Gray Television and Nexstar Media Group where the network is unable to maintain a main channel affiliation with or own a standalone station, for the same purpose as the distribution of Ion's main network feed via pay-TV providers and streaming services.\nThe network's stations cover all of the top 20 U.S. markets and 37 of the top 50 markets. Ion's owned-and-operated stations cover 64.8% of the United States population, by far the most of any American station ownership group; it is able to circumvent the legal limit of covering 39% of the population because all of its stations operate on the UHF television band, which is subject to a discount in regard to that limit. In the digital age, the restoration of the UHF discount has proven controversial with other broadcast groups and FCC rulings between presidential administrations, though as the network's parent company mainly acquired low-performing stations and stations on the fringes of markets which targeted lower-profile cities in the analog age, it has not been an issue with Ion Media itself.",

      "content": "In February 2022, two days after Russia's full-scale invasion, Ukraine requested that the American aerospace company SpaceX activate their Starlink satellite internet service in the country, to replace internet and communication networks degraded or destroyed during the war. Starlink has since been used by Ukrainian civilians, government and military. The satellite service has been employed for humanitarian purposes as well as defense and counterattacks on Russian positions.\nInitially, SpaceX provided and funded Starlink services to Ukraine largely on its own. As of June 2023 Starlink expenses for Ukraine are covered by the US Department of Defense through a contract with SpaceX. As of December 2023, Poland remains the largest single contributor of Starlink terminals to Ukraine, providing 19,500 out of 47,000 delivered. SpaceX executives have declined to extend Starlink availability to Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine like Crimea. This was criticized by Ukraine as it prevented them from carrying out military operations in those areas. Despite this, Starlink was considered in 2024 a reliable partner to Ukraine in the war, and has become a substitute for modern encrypted real-time communication in warfare.\nIn 2022, Elon Musk denied a Ukrainian request to extend Starlink's coverage up to Russian-occupied Crimea during a counterattack on a Crimean port, from which Russia had been launching attacks against Ukrainian civilians; doing so would have violated US sanctions on Russia. This event was widely reported in 2023, erroneously characterizing it as Musk \"turning off\" Starlink coverage in Crimea. SpaceX executives repeatedly stated that Starlink needed to remain a civilian network; in late 2022, as Starlink was being used as a tool in combat in Ukraine, SpaceX announced Starshield, a Starlink-like program designed for government customers. Musk is reported to have said that Ukraine was \"going too far\" in threatening to inflict a “strategic defeat” on the Kremlin.\nIn Russia, the use of Starlink to attack Russian targets has been criticized by government officials. Russia's military has repeatedly tried to disrupt Starlink services in Ukraine. Reportedly, the Russian military at one point obtained Starlink terminals through other countries. This unauthorized Starlink use was eventually blocked.\nThrough his company SpaceX and division Starlink, Elon Musk's involvement in the Russo-Ukrainian War has been significant, and met with concerns. In 2024, USAID's Inspector General notified Congress a probe was being launched to investigate, among other things, USAID's oversight of Starlink Satellite Terminals provided to the Ukrainian government.",

      "title": "Space tourism",
      "content": "Space tourism is human space travel for recreational purposes. There are several different types of space tourism, including orbital, suborbital and lunar space tourism. Tourists are motivated by the possibility of viewing Earth from space, feeling weightlessness, experiencing extremely high speed and something unusual, and contributing to science.\nSpace tourism started in April 2001, when American businessman and engineer Dennis Tito became the first ever space tourist to travel to space aboard a Soyuz-TM32 spacecraft. During the period from 2001 to 2009, seven space tourists made eight space flights aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft to the International Space Station, brokered by American company Space Adventures in conjunction with Roscosmos and RSC Energia. Iranian-American businesswoman Anousheh Ansari became the first ever female space tourist in September 2006. The publicized price was in the range of US$20–25 million per trip. Some space tourists have signed contracts with third parties to conduct certain research activities while in orbit. By 2007, space tourism was thought to be one of the earliest markets that would emerge for commercial spaceflight.\nSpace tourists need to be in good physical form before going to space. In particular, they have to train for fast acceleration or g-forces in a centrifuge and weightlessness by flying in a high-altitude jet plane doing parabolic arcs. They may have to learn how to operate and even fix parts of the spaceship using simulators.\nRussia halted orbital space tourism in 2010 due to the increase in the International Space Station crew size, using the seats for expedition crews that would previously have been sold to paying spaceflight participants. Orbital tourist flights were set to resume in 2015 but the planned flight was postponed indefinitely. Russian orbital tourism eventually resumed with the launch of Soyuz MS-20 in 2021.\nOn June 7, 2019, NASA announced that starting in 2020, the organization aims to start allowing private astronauts to go on the International Space Station, with the use of the SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft and the Boeing Starliner spacecraft for public astronauts, which is planned to be priced at 35,000 USD per day for one astronaut, and an estimated 50 million USD for the ride there and back.\nWork also continues towards developing suborbital space tourism vehicles. This is being done by aerospace companies like Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic. SpaceX announced in 2018 that they are planning on sending space tourists, including Yusaku Maezawa, on a free-return trajectory around the Moon on the Starship, however the project was cancelled on June 1, 2024.",

      "title": "Enceladus",
      "content": "Enceladus is the sixth-largest moon of Saturn and the 18th-largest in the Solar System. It is about 500 kilometers (310 miles) in diameter, about a tenth of that of Saturn's largest moon, Titan. It is covered by clean, freshly deposited snow hundreds of meters thick, making it one of the most reflective bodies of the Solar System. Consequently, its surface temperature at noon reaches only −198 °C (75.1 K; −324.4 °F), far colder than a light-absorbing body would be. Despite its small size, Enceladus has a wide variety of surface features, ranging from old, heavily cratered regions to young, tectonically deformed terrain.\nEnceladus was discovered on August 28, 1789, by William Herschel, but little was known about it until the two Voyager spacecraft, Voyager 1 and Voyager 2, flew by Saturn in 1980 and 1981. In 2005, the spacecraft Cassini started multiple close flybys of Enceladus, revealing its surface and environment in greater detail. In particular, Cassini discovered water-rich plumes venting from the south polar region. Cryovolcanoes near the south pole shoot geyser-like jets of water vapor, molecular hydrogen, other volatiles, and solid material, including sodium chloride crystals and ice particles, into space, totaling about 200 kilograms (440 pounds) per second. More than 100 geysers have been identified. Some of the water vapor falls back as snow, now several hundred meters thick; the rest escapes and supplies most of the material making up Saturn's E ring. According to NASA scientists, the plumes are similar in composition to comets. In 2014, NASA reported that Cassini had found evidence for a large south polar subsurface ocean of liquid water with a thickness of around 10 km (6 mi). The existence of Enceladus's subsurface ocean has since been mathematically modelled and replicated.\nThese observations of active cryoeruptions, along with the finding of escaping internal heat and very few (if any) impact craters in the south polar region, show that Enceladus is currently geologically active. Like many other satellites in the extensive systems of the giant planets, Enceladus participates in an orbital resonance. Its resonance with Dione excites its orbital eccentricity, which is damped by tidal forces, tidally heating its interior and driving the geological activity.\nCassini performed chemical analysis of Enceladus's plumes, finding evidence for hydrothermal activity, possibly driving complex chemistry. Ongoing research on Cassini data suggests that Enceladus's hydrothermal environment could be habitable to some of Earth's hydrothermal vent's microorganisms, and that plume-found methane could be produced by such organisms.",

      "title": "Dark matter",
      "content": "In astronomy, dark matter is an invisible and hypothetical form of matter that does not interact with light or other electromagnetic radiation. Dark matter is implied by gravitational effects that cannot be explained by general relativity unless more matter is present than can be observed. Such effects occur in the context of formation and evolution of galaxies, gravitational lensing, the observable universe's current structure, mass position in galactic collisions, the motion of galaxies within galaxy clusters, and cosmic microwave background anisotropies. Dark matter is thought to serve as gravitational scaffolding for cosmic structures.\nAfter the Big Bang, dark matter clumped into blobs along narrow filaments with superclusters of galaxies forming a cosmic web at scales on which entire galaxies appear like tiny particles.\nIn the standard Lambda-CDM model of cosmology, the mass–energy content of the universe is 5% ordinary matter, 26.8% dark matter, and 68.2% a form of energy known as dark energy. Thus, dark matter constitutes 85% of the total mass, while dark energy and dark matter constitute 95% of the total mass–energy content. While the density of dark matter is significant in the halo around a galaxy, its local density in the Solar System is much less than normal matter. The total of all the dark matter out to the orbit of Neptune would add up about 1017 kg, the same as a large asteroid.\nDark matter is not known to interact with ordinary baryonic matter and radiation except through gravity, making it difficult to detect in the laboratory. The most prevalent explanation is that dark matter is some as-yet-undiscovered subatomic particle, such as either weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) or axions. The other main possibility is that dark matter is composed of primordial black holes.\nDark matter is classified as \"cold\", \"warm\", or \"hot\" according to velocity (more precisely, its free streaming length). Recent models have favored a cold dark matter scenario, in which structures emerge by the gradual accumulation of particles.\nAlthough the astrophysics community generally accepts the existence of dark matter, a minority of astrophysicists, intrigued by specific observations that are not well explained by ordinary dark matter, argue for various modifications of the standard laws of general relativity. These include modified Newtonian dynamics, tensor–vector–scalar gravity, or entropic gravity. So far none of the proposed modified gravity theories can describe every piece of observational evidence at the same time, suggesting that even if gravity has to be modified, some form of dark matter will still be required.",

      "title": "Galaxy Science Fiction",
      "content": "Galaxy Science Fiction was an American digest-size science fiction magazine, published in Boston from 1950 to 1980. It was founded by a French-Italian company, World Editions, which was looking to break into the American market. World Editions hired as editor H. L. Gold, who rapidly made Galaxy the leading science fiction magazine of its time, focusing on stories about social issues rather than technology.\nGold published many notable stories during his tenure, including Ray Bradbury's \"The Fireman\", later expanded as Fahrenheit 451; Robert A. Heinlein's The Puppet Masters; and Alfred Bester's The Demolished Man. In 1952, the magazine was acquired by Robert Guinn, its printer. By the late 1950s, Frederik Pohl was helping Gold with most aspects of the magazine's production. When Gold's health worsened, Pohl took over as editor, starting officially at the end of 1961, though he had been doing the majority of the production work for some time.\nUnder Pohl Galaxy had continued success, regularly publishing fiction by writers such as Cordwainer Smith, Jack Vance, Harlan Ellison, and Robert Silverberg. Pohl never won the annual Hugo Award for his stewardship of Galaxy, winning three Hugos instead for its sister magazine, If.  In 1969 Guinn sold Galaxy to Universal Publishing and Distribution Corporation (UPD) and Pohl resigned, to be replaced by Ejler Jakobsson.  Under Jakobsson the magazine declined in quality.  It recovered under James Baen, who took over in mid-1974, but when he left at the end of 1977 the deterioration resumed, and there were financial problems—writers were not paid on time and the schedule became erratic.  By the end of the 1970s, the gaps between issues were lengthening, and the title was finally sold to Galileo publisher Vincent McCaffrey, who brought out only a single issue in 1980. A brief revival as a semi-professional magazine followed in 1994, edited by H. L. Gold's son, E. J. Gold; this lasted for eight bimonthly issues.\nAt its peak, Galaxy greatly influenced the science fiction genre.  It was regarded as one of the leading science fiction magazines almost from the start, and its influence did not wane until Pohl's departure in 1969. Gold brought a \"sophisticated intellectual subtlety\" to magazine science fiction according to Pohl, who added that \"after Galaxy it was impossible to go on being naive.\"  SF historian David Kyle commented that \"of all the editors in and out of the post-war scene, the most influential beyond any doubt was H. L. Gold\".  Kyle suggested that the new direction Gold set \"inevitably\" led to the experimental New Wave, the defining science fiction literary movement of the 1960s.",

      "content": "OSIRIS-REx was a NASA asteroid-study and sample-return mission that visited and collected samples from 101955 Bennu, a carbonaceous near-Earth asteroid. The material, returned in September 2023, is expected to enable scientists to learn more about the formation and evolution of the Solar System, its initial stages of planet formation, and the source of organic compounds that led to the formation of life on Earth. Following the completion of the primary OSIRIS-REx (Regolith Explorer) mission, the spacecraft is planned to conduct a flyby of asteroid 99942 Apophis, renamed as OSIRIS-APEX (Apophis Explorer).\nOSIRIS-REx was launched on September 8, 2016, flew past Earth on September 22, 2017, and rendezvoused with Bennu on December 3, 2018. It spent the next two years analyzing the surface to find a suitable site from which to extract a sample. On October 20, 2020, OSIRIS-REx touched down on Bennu and successfully collected a sample. OSIRIS-REx left Bennu on May 10, 2021 and returned its sample to Earth on September 24, 2023, subsequently starting its extended mission to study 99942 Apophis, where it will arrive  in April 2029.\nBennu was chosen as the target of study because it is a \"time capsule\" from the birth of the Solar System. Bennu has a very dark surface and is classified as a B-type asteroid, a sub-type of the carbonaceous C-type asteroids. Such asteroids are considered primitive, having undergone little geological change from their time of formation. In particular, Bennu was selected because of the availability of pristine carbonaceous material, a key element in organic molecules necessary for life as well as representative of matter from before the formation of Earth. Organic molecules, such as amino acids, have previously been found in meteorite and comet samples, indicating that some ingredients necessary for life can be naturally synthesized in outer space.\nThe cost of the OSIRIS-REx mission is approximately US$800 million, not including the Atlas V launch vehicle, which is about US$183.5 million. The OSIRIS-APEX extended mission costs an additional US$200 million. It is the third planetary science mission selected in the New Frontiers program, after Juno and New Horizons. The principal investigator is Dante Lauretta from the University of Arizona, having taken over in 2011 after the original PI Michael Julian Drake died four months after the mission won approval from NASA.\nOSIRIS-REx was the first United States spacecraft to return samples from an asteroid. Previous asteroid returns include the Japanese probes Hayabusa, which visited 25143 Itokawa in 2010, and Hayabusa2, which visited 162173 Ryugu in June 2018.",

      "content": "An earthworm is a soil-dwelling terrestrial invertebrate that belongs to the phylum Annelida. The term is the common name for the largest members of the class (or subclass, depending on the author) Oligochaeta. In classical systems, they were in the order of Opisthopora since the male pores opened posterior to the female pores, although the internal male segments are anterior to the female. Theoretical cladistic studies have placed them in the suborder Lumbricina of the order Haplotaxida, but this may change. Other slang names for earthworms include \"dew-worm\", \"rainworm\", \"nightcrawler\", and \"angleworm\" (from its use as angling hookbait). Larger terrestrial earthworms are also called megadriles (which translates to \"big worms\") as opposed to the microdriles (\"small worms\") in the semiaquatic families Tubificidae, Lumbricidae and Enchytraeidae. The megadriles are characterized by a distinct clitellum (more extensive than that of microdriles) and a vascular system with true capillaries.\nEarthworms are commonly found in moist, compost-rich soil, eating a wide variety of organic matters, which include detritus, living protozoa, rotifers, nematodes, bacteria, fungi and other microorganisms. An earthworm's digestive system runs the length of its body. They are one of nature's most important detritivores and coprophages, and also serve as food for many low-level consumers within the ecosystems.\nEarthworms exhibit an externally segmented tube-within-a-tube body plan with corresponding internal segmentations, and usually have setae on all segments. They have a cosmopolitan distribution wherever soil, water and temperature conditions allow. They have a double transport system made of coelomic fluid that moves within the fluid-filled coelom and a simple, closed circulatory system, and respire (breathe) via cutaneous respiration. As soft-bodied invertebrates, they lack a true skeleton, but their structure is maintained by fluid-filled coelom chambers that function as a hydrostatic skeleton.\nEarthworms have a central nervous system consisting of two ganglia above the mouth, one on either side, connected to an axial nerve running along its length to motor neurons and sensory cells in each segment. Large numbers of chemoreceptors concentrate near its mouth. Circumferential and longitudinal muscles edging each segment let the worm move. Similar sets of muscles line the gut tube, and their actions propel digested food toward the worm's anus.\nEarthworms are hermaphrodites: each worm carries male and female reproductive organs and  genital pores. When mating, two individual earthworms will exchange sperm and fertilize each other's ova.",

      "content": "Space Exploration Technologies Corp., commonly referred to as SpaceX, is an American space technology company headquartered at the Starbase development site in Starbase, Texas. Since its founding in 2002, the company has made numerous advances in rocket propulsion, reusable launch vehicles, human spaceflight and satellite constellation technology. As of 2025, SpaceX is the world's dominant space launch provider, its launch cadence eclipsing all others, including private competitors and national programs like the Chinese space program. SpaceX, NASA, and the United States Armed Forces work closely together by means of governmental contracts.\nSpaceX was founded by Elon Musk in 2002 with a vision of decreasing the costs of space launches, paving the way to a self-sustaining colony on Mars. In 2008, Falcon 1 successfully launched into orbit after three failed launch attempts. The company then moved towards the development of the larger Falcon 9 rocket and the Dragon 1 capsule to satisfy NASA's COTS contracts for deliveries to the International Space Station. By 2012, SpaceX finished all COTS test flights and began delivering Commercial Resupply Services missions to the International Space Station. Also around that time, SpaceX started developing hardware to make the Falcon 9 first stage reusable. The company demonstrated the first successful first-stage landing in 2015 and re-launch of the first stage in 2017. Falcon Heavy, built from three Falcon 9 boosters, first flew in 2018 after a more than decade-long development process. As of May 2025, the company's Falcon 9 rockets have landed and flown again more than 450 times, reaching 1–3 launches a week.\nThese milestones delivered the company much-needed investment and SpaceX sought to diversify its sources of income. In 2019, the first operational satellite of the Starlink internet satellite constellation came online. In subsequent years, Starlink generated the bulk of SpaceX's income and paved the way for its Starshield military counterpart. In 2020, SpaceX began to operate its Dragon 2 capsules to deliver crewed missions for NASA and private entities. Around this time, SpaceX began building test prototypes for Starship, which is the largest launch vehicle in history and aims to fully realize the company's vision of a fully-reusable, cost-effective and adaptable launch vehicle. SpaceX is also developing its own space suit and astronaut via its Polaris program as well as developing the human lander for lunar missions under NASA's Artemis program. SpaceX is not publicly traded; a space industry newspaper estimated that SpaceX has a revenue of over $10 billion in 2024.",

      "content": "The Hubble Space Telescope (HST or Hubble) is a space telescope that was launched into low Earth orbit in 1990 and remains in operation. It was not the first space telescope, but it is one of the largest and most versatile, renowned as a vital research tool and as a public relations boon for astronomy. The Hubble Space Telescope is named after astronomer Edwin Hubble and is one of NASA's Great Observatories. The Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) selects Hubble's targets and processes the resulting data, while the Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) controls the spacecraft.\nHubble features a 2.4 m (7 ft 10 in) mirror, and its five main instruments observe in the ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Hubble's orbit outside the distortion of Earth's atmosphere allows it to capture extremely high-resolution images with substantially lower background light than ground-based telescopes. It has recorded some of the most detailed visible light images, allowing a deep view into space. Many Hubble observations have led to breakthroughs in astrophysics, such as determining the rate of expansion of the universe.\nThe Hubble Space Telescope was funded and built in the 1970s by NASA with contributions from the European Space Agency. Its intended launch was in 1983, but the project was beset by technical delays, budget problems, and the 1986 Challenger disaster. Hubble was launched on STS-31 in 1990, but its main mirror had been ground incorrectly, resulting in spherical aberration that compromised the telescope's capabilities. The optics were corrected to their intended quality by a servicing mission, STS-61, in 1993.\nHubble is the only telescope designed to be maintained in space by astronauts. Five Space Shuttle missions repaired, upgraded, and replaced systems on the telescope, including all five of the main instruments. The fifth mission was initially canceled on safety grounds following the Columbia disaster (2003), but after NASA administrator Michael D. Griffin approved it, the servicing mission was completed in 2009. Hubble completed 30 years of operation in April 2020 and is predicted to last until 2030 to 2040.\nHubble is the visible light telescope in NASA's Great Observatories program; other parts of the spectrum are covered by the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, the Chandra X-ray Observatory, and the Spitzer Space Telescope (which covers the infrared bands).\nThe mid-IR-to-visible band successor to the Hubble telescope is the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which was launched on December 25, 2021, with the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope due to follow in 2027.",

The program's stated long-term goal is to establish a permanent base on the Moon to facilitate human missions to Mars. It is intended to reestablish a human presence on the Moon for the first time since the Apollo 17 mission in 1972 and continue the direct exploration of Mars begun with data from the Mariner 9 probe in the same year. \nTwo principal elements of the Artemis program are derived from the now-cancelled Constellation program: the Orion spacecraft (with the ESM instead of a US-built service module) and the Space Launch System's solid rocket boosters (originally developed for the Ares V). Other elements of the program, such as the Lunar Gateway space station and the Human Landing System, are in development by government space agencies and private spaceflight companies, collaborations bound by the Artemis Accords and governmental contracts.\nThe Space Launch System, Orion spacecraft and the Human Landing System form the main spaceflight infrastructure for Artemis, and the Lunar Gateway plays a supporting role in human habitation. Supporting infrastructures for Artemis include the Commercial Lunar Payload Services, development of ground infrastructures, Artemis Base Camp on the Moon, Moon rovers, and spacesuits. Some aspects of the program have been criticized, such as the use of a near-rectilinear halo orbit and the program's sustainability.\nOrion's first launch on the Space Launch System was originally set in 2016, but faced numerous delays; it launched on November 16, 2022 as the Artemis I mission, with robots and mannequins aboard. As of May 2025, the crewed Artemis II launch is expected to take place in early 2026, the Artemis III crewed lunar landing is scheduled for mid-2027, the Artemis IV docking with the Lunar Gateway is planned for late 2028, the Artemis V docking with the European Space Agency's ESPRIT, Canada's Canadarm3, and NASA's Lunar Terrain Vehicle is planned for early 2030, and the Artemis VI docking which is expected to integrate the Crew and Science Airlock with the Lunar Gateway station is planned for early 2031. After Artemis VI, NASA plans yearly landings on the Moon from then on.\nThe program faced its greatest existential threat as the economics of launch costs began to change drastically due to reusable launch vehicles in the early 2020s. After multiple sessions of Congress debated the viability of the program, it was ultimately funded by passage of the 2025 One Big Beautiful Bill Act.",

      "title": "Asteroid",
      "content": "An asteroid is a minor planet—an object larger than a meteoroid that is neither a planet nor an identified comet—that orbits within the inner Solar System or is co-orbital with Jupiter (Trojan asteroids). Asteroids are rocky, metallic, or icy bodies with no atmosphere, and are broadly classified into C-type (carbonaceous), M-type (metallic), or S-type (silicaceous). The size and shape of asteroids vary significantly, ranging from small rubble piles under a kilometer across to Ceres, a dwarf planet almost 1000 km in diameter. A body is classified as a comet, not an asteroid, if it shows a coma (tail) when warmed by solar radiation, although recent observations suggest a continuum between these types of bodies.\nOf the roughly one million known asteroids, the greatest number are located between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, approximately 2 to 4 AU from the Sun, in a region known as the main asteroid belt. The total mass of all the asteroids combined is only 3% that of Earth's Moon. The majority of main belt asteroids follow slightly elliptical, stable orbits, revolving in the same direction as the Earth and taking from three to six years to complete a full circuit of the Sun.\nAsteroids have historically been observed from Earth. The first close-up observation of an asteroid was made by the Galileo spacecraft. Several dedicated missions to asteroids were subsequently launched by NASA and JAXA, with plans for other missions in progress. NASA's NEAR Shoemaker studied Eros, and Dawn observed Vesta and Ceres. JAXA's missions Hayabusa and Hayabusa2 studied and returned samples of Itokawa and Ryugu, respectively. OSIRIS-REx studied Bennu, collecting a sample in 2020 which was delivered back to Earth in 2023. NASA's Lucy, launched in 2021, is tasked with studying ten different asteroids, two from the main belt and eight Jupiter trojans. Psyche, launched October 2023, aims to study the metallic asteroid Psyche. ESA's Hera, launched in October 2024, is intended to study the results of the DART impact. CNSA's Tianwen-2 was launched in May 2025, to explore the co-orbital near-Earth asteroid 469219 Kamoʻoalewa and the active asteroid 311P/PanSTARRS and collecting samples of the regolith of Kamo'oalewa.\nNear-Earth asteroids have the potential for catastrophic consequences if they strike Earth, with a notable example being the Chicxulub impact, widely thought to have induced the Cretaceous–Paleogene mass extinction. As an experiment to meet this danger, in September 2022 the Double Asteroid Redirection Test spacecraft successfully altered the orbit of the non-threatening asteroid Dimorphos by crashing into it.",

      "title": "Cosmic microwave background",
      "content": "The cosmic microwave background (CMB, CMBR), or relic radiation, is microwave radiation that fills all space in the observable universe. With a standard optical telescope, the background space between stars and galaxies is almost completely dark. However, a sufficiently sensitive radio telescope detects a faint background glow that is almost uniform and is not associated with any star, galaxy, or other object. This glow is strongest in the microwave region of the electromagnetic spectrum. The accidental discovery of the CMB in 1965 by American radio astronomers Arno Allan Penzias and Robert Woodrow Wilson was the culmination of work initiated in the 1940s.\nThe CMB is landmark evidence of the Big Bang theory for the origin of the universe. In the Big Bang cosmological models, during the earliest periods, the universe was filled with an opaque fog of dense, hot plasma of sub-atomic particles. As the universe expanded, this plasma cooled to the point where protons and electrons combined to form neutral atoms of mostly hydrogen. Unlike the plasma, these atoms could not scatter thermal radiation by Thomson scattering, and so the universe became transparent. Known as the recombination epoch, this decoupling event released photons to travel freely through space. However, the photons have grown less energetic due to the cosmological redshift associated with the expansion of the universe. The surface of last scattering refers to a shell at the right distance in space so photons are now received that were originally emitted at the time of decoupling.\nThe CMB is very smooth and uniform, but maps by sensitive detectors detect small but important temperature variations. Ground and space-based experiments such as COBE, WMAP and Planck have been used to measure these temperature inhomogeneities. The anisotropy structure is influenced by various interactions of matter and photons up to the point of decoupling, which results in a characteristic pattern of tiny ripples that varies with angular scale. The distribution of the anisotropy across the sky has frequency components that can be represented by a power spectrum displaying a sequence of peaks and valleys. The peak values of this spectrum hold important information about the physical properties of the early universe: the first peak determines the overall curvature of the universe, while the second and third peak detail the density of normal matter and so-called dark matter, respectively. Extracting fine details from the CMB data can be challenging, since the emission has undergone modification by foreground features such as galaxy clusters.",

      "title": "Titan (moon)",
      "content": "Titan is the largest moon of Saturn and the second-largest in the Solar System. It is the only moon known to have an atmosphere denser than the Earth's and is the only known object in space—other than Earth—on which there is clear evidence that stable bodies of liquid exist. Titan is one of seven gravitationally rounded moons of Saturn and the second-most distant among them. Frequently described as a planet-like moon, Titan is 50% larger in diameter than Earth's Moon and 80% more massive. It is the second-largest moon in the Solar System after Jupiter's Ganymede and is larger than Mercury; yet Titan is only 40% as massive as Mercury, because Mercury is mainly iron and rock while much of Titan is ice, which is less dense.\nDiscovered in 1655 by the Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens, Titan was the first known moon of Saturn and the sixth known planetary satellite (after Earth's moon and the four Galilean moons of Jupiter). Titan orbits Saturn at 20 Saturn radii or 1,200,000 km above Saturn's apparent surface. From Titan's surface, Saturn, disregarding its rings, subtends an arc of 5.09 degrees, and if it were visible through the moon's thick atmosphere, it would appear 11.4 times larger in the sky, in diameter, than the Moon from Earth, which subtends 0.48° of arc.\nTitan is primarily composed of ice and rocky material, with a rocky core surrounded by various layers of ice, including a crust of ice Ih and a subsurface layer of ammonia-rich liquid water. Much as with Venus before the Space Age, the dense opaque atmosphere prevented understanding of Titan's surface until the Cassini–Huygens mission in 2004 provided new information, including the discovery of liquid hydrocarbon lakes in Titan's polar regions and the discovery of its atmospheric super-rotation. The geologically young surface is generally smooth, with few impact craters, although mountains and several possible cryovolcanoes have been found.\nThe atmosphere of Titan is mainly nitrogen and methane; minor components lead to the formation of hydrocarbon clouds and heavy organonitrogen haze. Its climate—including wind and rain—creates surface features similar to those of Earth, such as dunes, rivers, lakes, seas (probably of liquid methane and ethane), and deltas, and is dominated by seasonal weather patterns as on Earth. With its liquids (both surface and subsurface) and robust nitrogen atmosphere, Titan's methane cycle nearly resembles Earth's water cycle, albeit at a much lower temperature of about 94 K (−179 °C; −290 °F). Due to these factors, Titan is called the most Earth-like celestial object in the Solar System.",

      "title": "NASA Space Launch System Operations Outlook",
      "content": "The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Space Launch System (SLS) Program, managed at the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), is working with the Ground Systems Development and Operations (GSDO) Program, based at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC), to deliver a new safe, affordable, and sustainable capability for human and scientific exploration beyond Earth's orbit (BEO). Larger than the Saturn V Moon rocket, SLS will provide 10 percent more thrust at liftoff in its initial 70 metric ton (t) configuration and 20 percent more in its evolved 130-t configuration. The primary mission of the SLS rocket will be to launch astronauts to deep space destinations in the Orion Multi- Purpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV), also in development and managed by the Johnson Space Center. Several high-priority science missions also may benefit from the increased payload volume and reduced trip times offered by this powerful, versatile rocket. Reducing the lifecycle costs for NASA's space transportation flagship will maximize the exploration and scientific discovery returned from the taxpayer's investment. To that end, decisions made during development of SLS and associated systems will impact the nation's space exploration capabilities for decades. This paper will provide an update to the operations strategy presented at SpaceOps 2012. It will focus on: 1) Preparations to streamline the processing flow and infrastructure needed to produce and launch the world's largest rocket (i.e., through incorporation and modification of proven, heritage systems into the vehicle and ground systems); 2) Implementation of a lean approach to reach-back support of hardware manufacturing, green-run testing, and launch site processing and activities; and 3) Partnering between the vehicle design and operations communities on state-of-the-art predictive operations analysis techniques. An example of innovation is testing the integrated vehicle at the processing facility in parallel, rather than sequentially, saving both time and money. These themes are accomplished under the context of a new cross-program integration model that emphasizes peer-to-peer accountability and collaboration towards a common, shared goal. Utilizing the lessons learned through 50 years of human space flight experience, SLS is assigning the right number of people from appropriate backgrounds, providing them the right tools, and exercising the right processes for the job. The result will be a powerful, versatile, and capable heavy-lift, human-rated asset for the future human and scientific exploration of space.",

      "title": "Jupiter's Legacy (comic)",
      "content": "Jupiter's Legacy is an American superhero comic book series, first published in 2013, written by Mark Millar, drawn by Frank Quitely, colored and lettered by Peter Doherty and published by Image Comics. Published as a series of eponymous limited series and interstitial prequel miniseries, it is to date the longest series that Millar had published as part of his Millarworld line of creator-owned comics, spanning an issue run three times as long as his then-most recent series, Supercrooks and Nemesis. It was also the first collaboration between Millar and Quitely since their work on The Authority in 2001, and Quitely's first long-form work with a writer other than Grant Morrison.\nThe story, which is influenced by Star Wars, King Kong, Roman mythology and origin stories from the Golden Age of Comics, was written as Millar's treatise on superheroes' connection to the American ideal. The first few issues of the opening story arc explore the generational conflict between a group of aging superheroes known as the Union, who used the powers they gained in 1932 for the betterment of mankind, in particular their leader, Sheldon Sampson (also known as the Utopian), and their children, who are daunted by the prospect of living up to their parents' legacy. Other conflicts and themes in the book include sociopolitical and economic differences among the older heroes and the end of capitalism, in the form of Sheldon's differences with his brother, Walter, which were inspired by Millar's reaction to the Great Recession.\nThe series received generally positive reviews, with praise given to Millar's writing, Quitely's art and Peter Doherty's colors, though more than one reviewer regarded the series' take on realistic superheroes as derivative.\nThe series' storyline is further explored in the spinoff series Jupiter's Circle, which depicts the lives of the six founding members of the Union in the 1950s and 1960s. The first volume of the spinoff debuted in 2015, and the second in November 2015. The sequel series Jupiter's Legacy: Requiem, which continues the storyline decades after the end of the original series, debuted in June 2021, also yielding positive critical reception.\nIn April 2015, it was announced that Millar had partnered with film producer Lorenzo di Bonaventura to adapt Jupiter's Legacy into feature films. In 2018, it was announced that Netflix, which acquired Millarworld the previous year, was developing a television adaptation of the comic series, with Steven S. DeKnight hired as showrunner and one of the executive producers. The series lasted one season.",

      "title": "Asteroid belt",
      "content": "The asteroid belt is a torus-shaped region in the Solar System, centered on the Sun and roughly spanning the space between the orbits of the planets Jupiter and Mars. It contains a great many solid, irregularly shaped bodies called asteroids or minor planets. The identified objects are of many sizes, but much smaller than planets, and, on average, are about one million kilometers (or six hundred thousand miles) apart. This asteroid belt is also called the main asteroid belt or main belt to distinguish it from other asteroid populations in the Solar System.\nThe  asteroid belt is the smallest and innermost circumstellar disc in the Solar System. Classes of small Solar System bodies in other regions are the near-Earth objects, the centaurs, the Kuiper belt objects, the scattered disc objects, the sednoids, and the Oort cloud objects. About 60% of the main belt mass is contained in the four largest asteroids: Ceres, Vesta, Pallas, and Hygiea. The total mass of the asteroid belt is estimated to be 3% that of the Moon.\nCeres, the only object in the asteroid belt large enough to be a dwarf planet, is about 950 km in diameter, whereas Vesta, Pallas, and Hygiea have mean diameters less than 600 km. The remaining mineralogically classified bodies range in size down to a few metres. The asteroid material is so thinly distributed that numerous uncrewed spacecraft have traversed it without incident. Nonetheless, collisions between large asteroids occur and can produce an asteroid family, whose members have similar orbital characteristics and compositions. Individual asteroids within the belt are categorized by their spectra, with most falling into three basic groups: carbonaceous (C-type), silicate (S-type), and metal-rich (M-type).\nThe asteroid belt formed from the primordial solar nebula as a group of planetesimals, the smaller precursors of the protoplanets. However, between Mars and Jupiter gravitational perturbations from Jupiter disrupted their accretion into a planet, imparting excess kinetic energy which shattered colliding planetesimals and most of the incipient protoplanets. As a result, 99.9% of the asteroid belt's original mass was lost in the first 100 million years of the Solar System's history. Some fragments eventually found their way into the inner Solar System, leading to meteorite impacts with the inner planets. Asteroid orbits continue to be appreciably perturbed whenever their period of revolution about the Sun forms an orbital resonance with Jupiter. At these orbital distances, a Kirkwood gap occurs as they are swept into other orbits.",

      "content": "The Solar System consists of the Sun and the objects that orbit it. The name comes from Sōl, the Latin name for the Sun. It formed about 4.6 billion years ago when a dense region of a molecular cloud collapsed, creating the Sun and a protoplanetary disc from which the orbiting bodies assembled. The fusion of hydrogen into helium inside the Sun's core releases energy, which is primarily emitted through its outer photosphere. This creates a decreasing temperature gradient across the system. Over 99.86% of the Solar System's mass is located within the Sun.\nThe most massive objects that orbit the Sun are the eight planets. Closest to the Sun in order of increasing distance are the four terrestrial planets – Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars. Only the Earth and Mars orbit within the Sun's habitable zone, where liquid water can exist on the surface. Beyond the frost line at about five astronomical units (AU), are two gas giants – Jupiter and Saturn – and two ice giants – Uranus and Neptune. Jupiter and Saturn possess nearly 90% of the non-stellar mass of the Solar System.\nThere are a vast number of less massive objects. There is a strong consensus among astronomers that the Solar System has at least nine dwarf planets: Ceres, Orcus, Pluto, Haumea, Quaoar, Makemake, Gonggong, Eris, and Sedna. Six planets, seven dwarf planets, and other bodies have orbiting natural satellites, which are commonly called 'moons', and range from sizes of dwarf planets, like Earth's Moon, to moonlets. There are small Solar System bodies, such as asteroids, comets, centaurs, meteoroids, and interplanetary dust clouds. Some of these bodies are in the asteroid belt (between Mars's and Jupiter's orbit) and the Kuiper belt (just outside Neptune's orbit).\nBetween the bodies of the Solar System is an interplanetary medium of dust and particles. The Solar System is constantly flooded by outflowing charged particles from the solar wind, forming the heliosphere. At around 70–90 AU from the Sun, the solar wind is halted by the interstellar medium, resulting in the heliopause. This is the boundary to interstellar space. The Solar System extends beyond this boundary with its outermost region, the theorized Oort cloud, the source for long-period comets, extending to a radius of 2,000–200,000 AU. The Solar System currently moves through a cloud of interstellar medium called the Local Cloud. The closest star to the Solar System, Proxima Centauri, is 4.25 light-years (269,000 AU) away. Both are within the Local Bubble, a relatively small 1,000 light-years wide region of the Milky Way.",

      "title": "Ionizing radiation",
      "content": "Ionizing radiation, also spelled ionising radiation, consists of subatomic particles or electromagnetic waves that have enough energy per individual photon or particle to ionize atoms or molecules by detaching electrons from them. Some particles can travel up to 99% of the speed of light, and the electromagnetic waves are on the high-energy portion of the electromagnetic spectrum.\nGamma rays, X-rays, and the higher energy ultraviolet part of the electromagnetic spectrum are ionizing radiation; whereas the lower energy ultraviolet, visible light, infrared, microwaves, and radio waves are non-ionizing radiation. Nearly all types of laser light are non-ionizing radiation. The boundary between ionizing and non-ionizing radiation in the ultraviolet area cannot be sharply defined, as different molecules and atoms ionize at different energies. The energy of ionizing radiation starts between 10 electronvolts (eV) and 33 eV.\nIonizing subatomic particles include alpha particles, beta particles, and neutrons. These particles are created by radioactive decay, and almost all are energetic enough to ionize. There are also secondary cosmic particles produced after cosmic rays interact with Earth's atmosphere, including muons, mesons, and positrons. Cosmic rays may also produce radioisotopes on Earth (for example, carbon-14), which in turn decay and emit ionizing radiation. Cosmic rays and the decay of radioactive isotopes are the primary sources of natural ionizing radiation on Earth, contributing to background radiation. Ionizing radiation is also generated artificially by X-ray tubes, particle accelerators, and nuclear fission.\nIonizing radiation is not immediately detectable by human senses, so instruments such as Geiger counters are used to detect and measure it. However, very high energy particles can produce visible effects on both organic and inorganic matter (e.g. water lighting in Cherenkov radiation) or humans (e.g. acute radiation syndrome).\nIonizing radiation is used in a wide variety of fields such as medicine, nuclear power, research, and industrial manufacturing, but is a health hazard if proper measures against excessive exposure are not taken. Exposure to ionizing radiation causes cell damage to living tissue and organ damage. In high acute doses, it will result in radiation burns and radiation sickness, and lower level doses over a protracted time can cause cancer. The International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) issues guidance on ionizing radiation protection, and the effects of dose uptake on human health.",

      "content": "Mathematics is a field of study that discovers and organizes methods, theories and theorems that are developed and proved for the needs of empirical sciences and mathematics itself. There are many areas of mathematics, which include number theory (the study of numbers), algebra (the study of formulas and related structures), geometry (the study of shapes and spaces that contain them), analysis (the study of continuous changes), and set theory (presently used as a foundation for all mathematics).\nMathematics involves the description and manipulation of abstract objects that consist of either abstractions from nature or—in modern mathematics—purely abstract entities that are stipulated to have certain properties, called axioms.  Mathematics uses pure reason to prove properties of objects, a proof consisting of a succession of applications of deductive rules to already established results. These results include previously proved theorems, axioms, and—in case of abstraction from nature—some basic properties that are considered true starting points of the theory under consideration.\nMathematics is essential in the natural sciences, engineering, medicine, finance, computer science, and the social sciences. Although mathematics is extensively used for modeling phenomena, the fundamental truths of mathematics are independent of any scientific experimentation. Some areas of mathematics, such as statistics and game theory, are developed in close correlation with their applications and are often grouped under applied mathematics. Other areas are developed independently from any application (and are therefore called pure mathematics) but often later find practical applications.\nHistorically, the concept of a proof and its associated mathematical rigour first appeared in Greek mathematics, most notably in Euclid's Elements. Since its beginning, mathematics was primarily divided into geometry and arithmetic (the manipulation of natural numbers and fractions), until the 16th and 17th centuries, when algebra and infinitesimal calculus were introduced as new fields. Since then, the interaction between mathematical innovations and scientific discoveries has led to a correlated increase in the development of both. At the end of the 19th century, the foundational crisis of mathematics led to the systematization of the axiomatic method, which heralded a dramatic increase in the number of mathematical areas and their fields of application. The contemporary Mathematics Subject Classification lists more than sixty first-level areas of mathematics.",

The film focuses on the story of John in his early days in England as a prodigy at the Royal Academy of Music through his musical partnership with Bernie Taupin. The story is told through his music and is titled after John's 1972 song \"Rocket Man\". Directed by Dexter Fletcher and written by Lee Hall, the film stars Taron Egerton as John, with Jamie Bell as Taupin, Richard Madden as John Reid, and Bryce Dallas Howard as Sheila Eileen, John's mother. A British-American venture, the film was produced by New Republic Pictures, Marv Films and Rocket Pictures, and was distributed by Paramount Pictures.\nThe film had been in development since the 2000s before it was announced in 2013 that Focus Features acquired the rights to the film and director Michael Gracey (who eventually served as executive producer) was attached to direct the film with actor Tom Hardy set to star. After both Hardy and Gracey left the project following creative differences between Focus and John that halted an initial production start in autumn 2014, the project languished for several years until Paramount Pictures and New Republic Pictures took over as distributor in April 2018, where Egerton and Fletcher signed on. Principal photography began in August 2018 and was completed later that year. John served as executive producer, while his husband David Furnish produced the film through their Rocket Pictures, alongside Matthew Vaughn's Marv Films.\nRocketman premiered at the Cannes Film Festival on 16 May 2019, and was theatrically released in the United Kingdom on 22 May 2019 and in the United States on 31 May 2019. It grossed $195 million worldwide against its $40 million budget and received positive reviews from critics, with praise for Egerton's performance. The film was the first by a major studio to include a gay male sex scene. For his performance, Egerton received numerous nominations, including the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role and Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role, and won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy. John and Taupin also won Best Original Song at the 77th Golden Globe Awards, Best Song at the 25th Critics' Choice Awards, and Best Original Song at the 92nd Academy Awards for \"(I'm Gonna) Love Me Again\", and earned four nominations at the 73rd British Academy Film Awards, including Outstanding British Film.",

      "title": "Supernova",
      "content": "A supernova (pl.: supernovae or supernovas) is a powerful and luminous explosion of a star. A supernova occurs during the last evolutionary stages of a massive star, or when a white dwarf is triggered into runaway nuclear fusion. The original object, called the progenitor, either collapses to a neutron star or black hole, or is completely destroyed to form a diffuse nebula. The peak optical luminosity of a supernova can be comparable to that of an entire galaxy before fading over several weeks or months.\nThe last supernova directly observed in the Milky Way was Kepler's Supernova in 1604, appearing not long after Tycho's Supernova in 1572, both of which were visible to the naked eye.  Observations of recent supernova remnants within the Milky Way, coupled with studies of supernovae in other galaxies, suggest that these powerful stellar explosions occur in our galaxy approximately three times per century on average.  A supernova in the Milky Way would almost certainly be observable through modern astronomical telescopes. The most recent naked-eye supernova was SN 1987A, which was the explosion of a blue supergiant star in the Large Magellanic Cloud, a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way in 1987.\nTheoretical studies indicate that most supernovae are triggered by one of two basic mechanisms: the sudden re-ignition of nuclear fusion in a white dwarf, or the sudden gravitational collapse of a massive star's core.\n\nIn the re-ignition of a white dwarf, the object's temperature is raised enough to trigger runaway nuclear fusion, completely disrupting the star. Possible causes are an accumulation of material from a binary companion through accretion, or by a stellar merger.\nIn the case of a massive star's sudden implosion, the core of a massive star will undergo sudden collapse once it is unable to produce sufficient energy from fusion to counteract the star's own gravity, which must happen once the star begins fusing iron, but may happen during an earlier stage of metal fusion.\nSupernovae can expel several solar masses of material at speeds up to several percent of the speed of light. This drives an expanding shock wave into the surrounding interstellar medium, sweeping up an expanding shell of gas and dust observed as a supernova remnant. Supernovae are a major source of elements in the interstellar medium from oxygen to rubidium. The expanding shock waves of supernovae can trigger the formation of new stars. Supernovae are a major source of cosmic rays. They might also produce gravitational waves.",

      "content": "Picosecond two-photon absorption laser induced fluorescence (ps--TALIF) is\ncombined with a streak camera ($\\sim$1 ps highest temporal resolution) to probe\nthe effective lifetime ($\\tau_{eff_{H(n=3)}}$) and absolute density ($N_H$) of\natomic hydrogen in the effluent of a helium atmospheric-pressure microplasma\njet ($\\mu$APPJ). This approach allows for improved temporal resolution compared\nto conventional nanosecond diagnostics, enabling measurements of\n$\\tau_{eff_{H(n=3)}}$ as small as 50 ps, the corresponding $N_H$ reaching down\nto $10^{14} cm^{-3}$. Atomic densities are calibrated by performing identical\nps--TALIF measurements in krypton gas contained in a custom-built low-pressure\ncuvette. Physical mechanisms that may be involved in the TALIF scheme such as\nphotoionisation and/or stimulated emission are also assessed, ensuring reliable\nstudies. The determined $\\tau_{eff_{H(n=3)}}$ and $N_H$ increase with the\nhelium flow rate ($Q_{He}$) in the range $Q_{He}=0.3-1$ slm. Both quantities\nare maximized near the exit nozzle of the $\\mu$APPJ, obtaining values below 400\nps and $6x10^{14} cm^{-3}$, respectively. As the axial distance increases,\n$\\tau_{eff_{H(n=3)}}$ declines with a rate of $\\approx$65 ps/mm for $Q_{He}=1$\nslm which is about 3 times smaller than for $Q_{He}=0.3$ slm. These findings\nreveal a strong correlation between the experimentally-measured\n$\\tau_{eff_{H(n=3)}}$ and the local air entrainment into the jet as indicated\nby their comparison with calculated effective lifetimes based on published\nquenching rates. Furthermore, operating the $\\mu$APPJ in the burst mode allows\nfor the estimation of the residence time ($t_{res}$) of ground state H--atoms\nin the helium gas channel, which is larger for $Q_{He}=0.3$ slm ($t_{res}\n\\approx 1.2 ms$) compared to $Q_{He}=1$ slm ($t_{res} \\approx 0.5 ms$). H-atoms\nconsumption in the gas channel can be affected by diffusion and mechanisms\ninvolving neutral ground-state and metastable species among others.\nFurthermore, based on an error propagation analysis, density uncertainty as\nhigh as 64% (depending on the operating condition) is revealed. This mainly\noriginates in the ratio of the two-photon absorption cross sections of Kr and H\natoms ( $\\sigma^{(2)}Kr$ / $\\sigma^{(2)}H$) which has not yet been measured in\nthe picosecond regime. Nevertheless, the combined utilisation of ps--TALIF and\nstreak camera diagnostics demonstrates high sensitivity and temporal resolution\nfor directly probing key reactive species in atmospheric pressure microplasmas.",

      "title": "Plutonium Finishing Plant",
      "content": "The Plutonium Finishing Plant, also known as the Z Plant, was part of the Hanford Site plutonium production complex in Washington state. During World War II, Hanford produced plutonium nitrate (Pu(NO3)2), which was shipped to the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos Laboratory, where it was turned into metallic plutonium and made into pits for nuclear weapons. After the war ended, the Los Alamos Laboratory moved to divest itself of production activities in order to devote itself to research. The Plutonium Finishing Plant was built at Hanford to carry out the purification and reduction of the plutonium to metallic form, known as \"buttons\", and then perform the casting, grinding and lathing of the plutonium to turn it into pits.\nThe plant operated from 1949 to 1989. In 1953, it began shipping plutonium buttons to the new Rocky Flats Plant in Colorado, which fabricated pits. Plutonium production peaked in 1965, when 4,500 kilograms was produced. Between 1957 and 1961, nine different types of pits were produced at Hanford. Pit production ended in 1965, when the Atomic Energy Commission announced that henceforth this work would be undertaken at the Rocky Flats Site. As demand for weapons-grade plutonium declined after 1964, the Plutonium Finishing Plant began producing mixed plutonium-oxide uranium-oxide (MOX) fuel for Hanford's Fast Flux Test Facility and reactor-grade plutonium.\nPlutonium was valuable, and reducing waste saved landfill dispatches and preserved the long-term radiological safety of the area by not burying the highly contaminated waste. The Plutonium Finishing Plant reclaimed solid waste in its RECUPLEX facility, combustible waste in the 232-Z Incinerator, and liquid waste in the 242-Z Waste Treatment Facility. A multi-purpose Plutonium Reclamation Facility opened in 1964. A serious accident at the 242-Z Waste Treatment Facility occurred in 1976, when the contents of a glove box containing americium and plutonium exploded, seriously injuring an operator, Harold McCluskey. This accident prompted a series of reviews and evaluations that led to the 1978 Department of Energy decision to close most of the Plutonium Finishing Plant's facilities. Before the plant could be demolished, approximately 18 metric tons of plutonium-bearing material was stabilized between 1996 and 2004. Legacy plutonium from plant systems was removed by 2005, and all weapons-grade plutonium was shipped to the Savannah River Site by 2009. Demolition work on the plant began in 2017 and was completed in 2021.",

      "title": "Apollo 11",
      "content": "Apollo 11 was a spaceflight conducted from July 16 to 24, 1969, by the United States and launched by NASA. It marked the first time that humans landed on the Moon. Commander Neil Armstrong and Lunar Module pilot Buzz Aldrin landed the Lunar Module Eagle on July 20, 1969, at 20:17 UTC, and Armstrong became the first person to step onto the Moon's surface six hours and 39 minutes later, on July 21 at 02:56 UTC. Aldrin joined him 19 minutes later, and they spent about two and a quarter hours together exploring the site they had named Tranquility Base upon landing. Armstrong and Aldrin collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material to bring back to Earth as pilot Michael Collins flew the Command Module Columbia in lunar orbit, and were on the Moon's surface for 21 hours, 36 minutes, before lifting off to rejoin Columbia.\nApollo 11 was launched by a Saturn V rocket from Kennedy Space Center on Merritt Island, Florida, on July 16 at 13:32 UTC. It was the fifth crewed mission of NASA's Apollo program. The Apollo spacecraft had three parts: a command module (CM) with a cabin for the three astronauts, the only part that returned to Earth; a service module (SM), which supported the command module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a lunar module (LM) that had two stages—a descent stage for landing on the Moon and an ascent stage to place the astronauts back into lunar orbit.\nAfter being sent to the Moon by the Saturn V's third stage, the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered lunar orbit. Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into Eagle and landed in the Mare Tranquillitatis on July 20. The astronauts used Eagle's ascent stage to lift off from the lunar surface and rejoin Collins in the command module. They jettisoned Eagle before they performed the maneuvers that propelled Columbia out of the last of its 30 lunar orbits onto a trajectory back to Earth. They returned to Earth and splashed down in the Pacific Ocean on July 24 after more than eight days in space.\nArmstrong's first step onto the lunar surface was broadcast on live TV to a worldwide audience. He described the event as \"one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.\" Apollo 11 effectively proved U.S. victory in the Space Race to demonstrate spaceflight superiority, by fulfilling a national goal proposed in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy, \"before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth.\"",

      "title": "SpaceX reusable launch system development program",
      "content": "SpaceX has privately funded the development of orbital launch systems that can be reused many times, similar to the reusability of aircraft. SpaceX has developed technologies since the 2010s to facilitate full and rapid reuse of space launch vehicles. The project's long-term objectives include returning a launch vehicle first stage to the launch site within minutes and to return a second stage to the launch pad, following orbital realignment with the launch site and atmospheric reentry in up to 24 hours. SpaceX's long term goal would have been reusability of both stages of their orbital launch vehicle, and the first stage would be designed to allow reuse a few hours after return. Development of reusable second stages for Falcon 9 was later abandoned in favor of developing Starship. However, SpaceX still developed reusable payload fairings for the Falcon 9.\nThe program was announced in 2011. SpaceX first achieved a successful landing and recovery of a first stage in December 2015. The first re-flight of a landed first stage occurred in March 2017 with the second occurring in June 2017, that one only five months after the maiden flight of the booster. The third attempt occurred in October 2017 with the SES-11/EchoStar-105 mission. Reflights of refurbished first stages then became routine. In May 2021, B1051 became the first booster to launch ten missions.\nThe reusable launch system technology was initially developed for the first stage of Falcon 9. After stage separation, the booster flips around (an optional boostback burn reverses its course), a reentry burn sheds gravity-induced speed to prevent stage overheating as the spacecraft reenters the thicker part of the atmosphere, and a landing burn accomplishes the final low-altitude deceleration and touchdown.\nSpaceX planned since at least 2014 to develop reusable second stages, a more challenging engineering problem because the vehicle is traveling at orbital velocity. Second stage reuse is considered vital to Elon Musk's plans for settlement of Mars. Initial concepts for a reusable Falcon 9 second stage were abandoned by 2018.\nAs of 2023, SpaceX is developing the Starship system to be a fully-reusable two-stage launch vehicle, intended to replace all of its other launch vehicles and spacecraft for satellite delivery and human transport—Falcon 9, Falcon Heavy, and Dragon—and eventually support flights to the Moon and Mars. It could theoretically be used for point-to-point transportation on Earth.",

      "title": "Miranda warning",
      "content": "In the United States, the Miranda warning is a type of notification customarily given by police to criminal suspects in police custody (or in a custodial interrogation) advising them of their right to silence and, in effect, protection from self-incrimination; that is, their right to refuse to answer questions or provide information to law enforcement or other officials. Named for the U.S. Supreme Court's 1966 decision Miranda v. Arizona, these rights are often referred to as Miranda rights. The purpose of such notification is to preserve the admissibility of their statements made during custodial interrogation in later criminal proceedings. The idea came from law professor Yale Kamisar, who subsequently was dubbed \"the father of Miranda.\"\nThe language used in Miranda warnings derives from the Supreme Court's opinion in its Miranda decision. But the specific language used in the warnings varies between jurisdictions, and the warning is deemed adequate as long as the defendant's rights are properly disclosed such that any waiver of those rights by the defendant is knowing, voluntary, and intelligent. For example, the warning may be phrased as follows:\n\nYou have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to talk to a lawyer for advice before we ask you any questions. You have the right to have a lawyer with you during questioning. If you cannot afford a lawyer, one will be appointed for you before any questioning if you wish. If you decide to answer questions now without a lawyer present, you have the right to stop answering at any time.\nThe Miranda warning is part of a preventive criminal procedure rule that law enforcement are required to administer to protect an individual who is in custody and subject to direct questioning or its functional equivalent from a violation of their Fifth Amendment right against compelled self-incrimination. In Miranda v. Arizona, the Supreme Court held that the admission of an elicited incriminating statement by a suspect not informed of these rights violates the Fifth Amendment and the Sixth Amendment right to counsel, through the incorporation of these rights into state law. Thus, if law enforcement officials decline to offer a Miranda warning to an individual in their custody, they may interrogate that person and act upon the knowledge gained, but may not ordinarily use that person's statements as evidence against them in a criminal trial.",

She has been ranked as the world No. 1 in women's singles by the WTA for 11 weeks, and as the world No. 1 in women's doubles for eight weeks. Williams has won 49 WTA Tour–level singles titles, including seven majors (five at Wimbledon and two at the US Open), as well as a gold medal at the 2000 Sydney Olympics. She has also won 22 doubles titles, including 14 majors and three Olympic gold medals.\nAlong with her younger sister, Serena, Venus Williams was coached by her parents Oracene Price and Richard Williams. Turning professional in 1994, she reached her first major final as a 17-year-old at the 1997 US Open. In 2000 and 2001, Williams claimed the Wimbledon and US Open titles, as well as Olympic singles gold at the Sydney Olympics. She first reached the singles world No. 1 ranking on 25 February 2002, becoming the first African American woman to do so in the Open era, and the second of all time after Althea Gibson. She reached four consecutive major finals between 2002 and 2003, but lost each time to Serena. She then suffered from injuries, winning just one major title between 2003 and 2006. Williams returned to form starting in 2007, when she won Wimbledon (a feat she repeated the following year). In 2010, she returned to the world No. 2 position in singles, but then suffered again from injuries. Starting in 2014, she gradually returned to form, culminating in two major final appearances in 2017 at the Australian Open and Wimbledon Championships.\nAlong with her seven singles major titles, Williams has won 14 women's doubles major titles, all partnering Serena; the pair are unbeaten in major doubles finals. She became the world No. 1 in doubles for the first time on June 7, 2010, alongside Serena, after the pair completed a non-calendar-year Grand Slam at the French Open. The pair also won three Olympic gold medals in women's doubles, in 2000, 2008, and 2012, adding to Venus' singles gold in 2000 and her mixed doubles silver in 2016. Williams has also won two mixed doubles major titles for a combined total of 23 major titles.\nThe Williams sisters are credited with ushering in a new era of power and athleticism on the women's professional tennis tour. Venus Williams was twice the season prize money leader (in 2001 and 2017), and ranks second behind Serena in all-time career prize money winnings, having earned over US$42 million as of March 2022.",

      "title": "Starship Troopers (film)",
      "content": "Starship Troopers is a 1997 American satirical science fiction action film directed by Paul Verhoeven and written by Edward Neumeier, based on the 1959 novel by Robert A. Heinlein. Set in the 23rd century, the story follows teenager Johnny Rico and his comrades as they serve in the military of the United Citizen Federation, an Earth-based world government engaged in an interstellar war against an alien species known as the Arachnids. The film stars Casper Van Dien, Dina Meyer, Denise Richards, Jake Busey, Neil Patrick Harris, Patrick Muldoon, and Michael Ironside.\nDevelopment of Starship Troopers began in 1991 as Bug Hunt at Outpost 7, written by Neumeier. After recognizing similarities between Neumeier's script and Heinlein's book, producer Jon Davison suggested aligning the script more closely with the novel to garner greater interest from studio executives. Despite these efforts development was slow, with studios hesitant to fund the costly project right up to the start of filming. Principal photography took place between April and October 1996 on a $100–110 million budget, of which nearly half was spent on the extensive computer-generated imagery (CGI) and practical effects required to vivify the Arachnid creatures.\nReleased on November 7, 1997, Starship Troopers faced critical backlash, with reviewers interpreting the film as endorsing fascism and disparaging its violence and cast performances. Despite initial box office success, collections slowed down amid negative reviews and unfavorable word of mouth, culminating in a $121 million total gross against its budget, which made it the 34th-highest-grossing film of 1997. The disappointing performance of Starship Troopers was blamed, in part, on competition from a high number of successful or anticipated science fiction and genre films released that year, its satire and violence failing to connect with mainstream audiences, and ineffective marketing.\nSince its release, Starship Troopers has been critically re-evaluated and is now considered a cult classic and a prescient satire of fascism and authoritarian governance that has grown in relevance. The film launched a multimedia franchise that includes four sequels—Starship Troopers 2: Hero of the Federation (2004), Starship Troopers 3: Marauder (2008), Starship Troopers: Invasion (2012), and Starship Troopers: Traitor of Mars (2017)—as well as a 1999 animated television series, video games, comics, and a variety of merchandise.",

      "content": "Ganymede is a natural satellite of Jupiter and the largest and most massive in the Solar System. Like Saturn's largest moon Titan, it is larger than the planet Mercury, but has somewhat less surface gravity than Mercury, Io, or the Moon due to its lower density compared to the three. Ganymede orbits Jupiter in roughly seven days and is in a 1:2:4 orbital resonance with the moons Europa and Io, respectively.\nGanymede is composed of silicate rock and water in approximately equal proportions. It is a fully differentiated body with an iron-rich, liquid metallic core, giving it the lowest moment of inertia factor of any solid body in the Solar System. Its internal ocean potentially contains more water than all of Earth's oceans combined. \nGanymede's magnetic field is probably created by convection within its core, and influenced by tidal forces from Jupiter's far greater magnetic field. Ganymede has a thin oxygen atmosphere that includes O, O2, and possibly O3 (ozone). Atomic hydrogen is a minor atmospheric constituent. Whether Ganymede has an ionosphere associated with its atmosphere is unresolved.\nGanymede's surface is composed of two main types of terrain, the first of which are lighter regions, generally crosscut by extensive grooves and ridges, dating from slightly less than 4 billion years ago, covering two-thirds of Ganymede. The cause of the light terrain's disrupted geology is not fully known, but may be the result of tectonic activity due to tidal heating.  The second terrain type are darker regions saturated with impact craters, which are dated to four billion years ago.\nGanymede's discovery is credited to Simon Marius and Galileo Galilei, who both observed it in 1610, as the third of the Galilean moons, the first group of objects discovered orbiting another planet. Its name was soon suggested by astronomer Simon Marius, after the mythological Ganymede, a Trojan prince desired by Zeus (the Greek counterpart of Jupiter), who carried him off to be the cupbearer of the gods.\nBeginning with Pioneer 10, several spacecraft have explored Ganymede. The Voyager probes, Voyager 1 and Voyager 2, refined measurements of its size, while Galileo discovered its underground ocean and magnetic field. The next planned mission to the Jovian system is the European Space Agency's Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE), which was launched in 2023. After flybys of all three icy Galilean moons, it is planned to enter orbit around Ganymede.",

      "content": "The Apollo 11 missing tapes were those that were recorded from Apollo 11's slow-scan television (SSTV) telecast in its raw format on telemetry data tape at the time of the first Moon landing in 1969 and subsequently lost. \nThe data tapes were used to record all transmitted data (video as well as telemetry) for backup.\nTo broadcast the SSTV transmission on standard television, NASA ground receiving stations performed real-time scan conversion to the NTSC television format. The moonwalk's converted video signal was broadcast live around the world on July 21, 1969 (2:56 UTC). At the time, the NTSC broadcast was recorded on many videotapes and kinescope films. Many of these low-quality recordings remain intact. As the real-time broadcast worked and was widely recorded, preservation of the backup video was not deemed a priority in the years immediately following the mission. In the early 1980s, NASA's Landsat program was facing a severe data tape shortage and it is likely the tapes were erased and reused at this time.\nA team of retired NASA employees and contractors tried to find the tapes in the early 2000s but was unable to do so. The search was sparked when several still photographs appeared in the late 1990s that showed the visually superior raw SSTV transmission on ground-station monitors. The research team conducted a multi-year investigation in the hopes of finding the most pristine and detailed video images of the moonwalk. If copies of the original SSTV format tapes were to be found, more modern digital technology could make a higher-quality conversion, yielding better images than those originally seen. The researchers concluded that the tapes containing the raw unprocessed Apollo 11 SSTV signal were erased and reused by NASA in the early 1980s, following standard procedure at the time. \nAlthough the researchers never found the telemetry tapes, they did discover the best visual quality NTSC videotapes as well as Super 8 movie film taken of a video monitor in Australia, showing the SSTV transmission before it was converted. These visual elements were processed in 2009, as part of a NASA-approved restoration project of the first moonwalk. At a 2009 news conference in Washington, D.C., the research team released its findings regarding the tapes' disappearance. They also partially released newly enhanced footage obtained during the search. Lowry Digital completed the full moonwalk restoration project in late 2009.",

      "title": "SpaceX Starship",
      "content": "Starship is a two-stage, fully reusable, super heavy-lift launch vehicle under development by American aerospace company SpaceX. Currently built and launched from Starbase in Texas, it is intended as the successor to company's Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets, and is part of SpaceX's broader reusable launch system development program. If completed as designed, Starship would be the first fully reusable orbital rocket and have the highest payload capacity of any launch vehicle to date. As of 28 May 2025, Starship has launched 9 times, with 4 successful flights and 5 failures.\nThe vehicle consists of two stages: the Super Heavy booster and the Starship spacecraft, both powered by Raptor engines burning liquid methane (the main component of natural gas) and liquid oxygen. Both stages are intended to return to the launch site and land vertically at the launch tower for potential reuse. Once in space, the Starship upper stage is intended to function as a standalone spacecraft capable of carrying crew and cargo. Missions beyond low Earth orbit would require multiple in-orbit refueling flights. At the end of its mission, Starship reenters the atmosphere using heat shield tiles similar to those of the Space Shuttle. SpaceX states that its goal is to reduce launch costs by both reusing and mass producing both stages.\nSpaceX has proposed a wide range of missions for Starship, such as deploying large satellites, space station modules, and space telescopes. A crewed variant, developed under contract with NASA, is called the Starship Human Landing System, which is scheduled to deliver astronauts to the Moon as part Artemis program, beginning with Artemis III currently scheduled for 2027. SpaceX has also expressed ambitions to use Starship for crewed missions to Mars.\nSpaceX began developing concepts for a super heavy-lift reusable launch vehicle as early as 2005, when it was called BFR (Big Falcon Rocket). Starship's current design and name were introduced in 2018. Development has followed an iterative and incremental approach, involving a high number of test flights and prototype vehicles. The first launch of a full Starship vehicle occurred on April 20, 2023, and ended with the explosion of the rocket four minutes after liftoff. The program has failed to meet many of its optimistic schedule goals and its development has had a number of setbacks, including four consecutive upper-stage failures in the first half of 2025.",

      "title": "Space law",
      "content": "Space law is the body of law governing space-related activities, encompassing both international and domestic agreements, rules, and principles. Parameters of space law include space exploration, liability for damage, weapons use, rescue efforts, environmental preservation, information sharing, new technologies, and ethics. Other fields of law, such as administrative law, intellectual property law, arms control law, insurance law, environmental law, criminal law, and commercial law, are also integrated within space law.\nThe origins of space law date back to 1919, with international law recognizing each country's sovereignty over the airspace directly above their territory, later reinforced at the Chicago Convention in 1944. The onset of domestic space programs during the Cold War propelled the official creation of international space policy (i.e., the International Geophysical Year) initiated by the International Council of Scientific Unions. The Soviet Union's 1957 launch of the world's first artificial satellite, Sputnik 1, directly spurred the United States Congress to pass the Space Act, thus creating the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Because space exploration required crossing transnational boundaries, it was during this era where space law became a field independent from traditional aerospace law.\nSince the Cold War, the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies (the \"Outer Space Treaty\") and the International Telecommunication Union have served as the constitutional legal framework and set of principles and procedures constituting space law. Further, the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS), along with its Legal and Scientific and Technical Subcommittees, is responsible for debating issues of international space law and policy. The United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs (UNOOSA) serves as the secretariat of the committee and promotes Access to Space for All through a wide range of conferences and capacity-building programs. Challenges that space law will continue to face in the future are fourfold—spanning across dimensions of domestic compliance, international cooperation, ethics, and the advent of scientific innovations. Furthermore, specific guidelines on the definition of airspace have yet to be universally determined.",

      "content": "Astronomy has been a favorite and significant component of mythology and religion throughout history. Astronomy and cosmology are parts of the myths of many cultures and religion around the world. Astronomy and religion have long been closely intertwined, particularly during the early history of astronomy.  Archaeological evidence of many ancient cultures demonstrates that celestial bodies were the subject of worship during the Stone and Bronze Ages. Amulets and stone walls in northern Europe depict arrangements of stars in constellations that match their historical positions, particularly circumpolar constellations. These date back as much as 30,000–40,000 years. \nIn many ancient religions, the northern circumpolar stars were associated with darkness, death and the underworld of the dead. For the Aztecs, the northern stars were associated with Tezcatlipoca. In Peking, China, was a shrine devoted to the North Star deity. Such worship of the northern stars may have been associated with time keeping, as the positions of the stars could identify the annual seasons. Likewise, as agriculture developed, the need to keep accurate time led to more careful tracking of the positions of the sun, moon and planets; resulting with their deification when they became inextricably linked with the means of survival.  In the ancient Egyptian calendar, the date of the annual flooding of the Nile was predicted by observing the heliacal rising of a star.  Indeed, the belief in a strong association between the events on the earth and in the heavens led to the development of astrology.\nThe first recorded conflict between religious orthodoxy and astronomy occurred with the Greek astronomer Anaxagoras. His beliefs that the heavenly bodies were the result of an evolutionary process and that the sun was a great burning stone (rather than the deity Helios), resulted in his arrest. He was charged with contravening the established religious beliefs. Although acquitted, he was forced to go into retirement.\nAs science expanded during the Renaissance, the secular beliefs of scientific investigators encountered the opposition of Christian orthodoxy. The most famous such conflict was that of Galileo Galilei, who was tried by the Inquisition on suspicion of heresy. However, many astronomers were also highly religious and attempted to reconcile their beliefs with the discoveries they made following the invention of the telescope.",

      "title": "Apollo 13",
      "content": "Apollo 13 (April 11–17, 1970) was the seventh crewed mission in the Apollo space program and would have been the third Moon landing. The craft was launched from Kennedy Space Center on April 11, 1970, but the landing was aborted after an oxygen tank in the service module (SM) exploded two days into the mission, disabling its electrical and life-support system. The crew, supported by backup systems on the Apollo Lunar Module (LM), instead looped around the Moon in a circumlunar trajectory and returned safely to Earth on April 17. The mission was commanded by Jim Lovell, with Jack Swigert as command module (CM) pilot and Fred Haise as Lunar Module (LM) pilot. Swigert was a late replacement for Ken Mattingly, who was grounded after exposure to rubella.\nA routine stir of an oxygen tank ignited damaged wire insulation inside it, causing an explosion that vented the contents of both of the SM's oxygen tanks to space. Without oxygen, needed for breathing and for generating electrical power, the SM's propulsion and life support systems could not operate. The CM's systems had to be shut down to conserve its remaining resources for reentry, forcing the crew to transfer to the LM as a lifeboat. With the lunar landing canceled, mission controllers worked to bring the crew home alive.\nAlthough the LM was designed to support two men on the lunar surface for two days, Mission Control in Houston improvised new procedures so it could support three men for four days. The crew experienced great hardship, caused by limited power, a chilly and wet cabin and a shortage of potable water. There was a critical need to adapt the CM's cartridges for the carbon dioxide scrubber system to work in the LM; the crew and mission controllers were successful in improvising a solution. The astronauts' peril briefly renewed public interest in the Apollo program; tens of millions watched the splashdown in the South Pacific Ocean on television.\nAn investigative review board found fault with preflight testing of the oxygen tank and Teflon being placed inside it. The board recommended changes, including minimizing the use of potentially combustible items inside the tank; this was done for Apollo 14. The story of Apollo 13 has been dramatized several times, most notably in the 1995 film Apollo 13 based on Lost Moon, the 1994 memoir co-authored by Lovell – and an episode of the 1998 miniseries From the Earth to the Moon.",

      "title": "Be–white dwarf X-ray binary system",
      "content": "Be–white dwarf X-ray binary systems (BeWDs) are a rare type of X-ray binary consisting of a white dwarf that accretes matter from a rapidly-rotating Be star. These systems form through binary evolution where mass transfer spins up the accretor to become a Be star while the donor evolves into a white dwarf.\nBeWDs probably originate from a Be star and a subdwarf O or B star binaries. Population synthesis models indicate these systems can evolve through two primary pathways:\n\nApproximately 60-70% merge into red giants that observationally look like luminous red novae.\nAbout 30-40% evolve into double white dwarf systems that may be detectable as gravitational wave sources by Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), and will be its \"most likely gravitational wave source\".\nThe formation requires specific initial conditions: the primary must transfer sufficient mass to spin up the secondary to Be star velocities without triggering common envelope evolution. Tidal synchronization mechanisms explain the observed lack of BeWDs with orbital periods shorter than 17 days.\nBeWDs can be identified by several features:\n\nSupersoft X-ray emission (kT ~ 0.1 keV)\nX-ray luminosities of 1033-1038 erg/s\nDeep nitrogen (0.67 keV) and oxygen (0.87 keV) absorption edges in X-ray spectra\nThe white dwarfs in these systems tend to be massive (0.9-1.35 M☉) with surface temperatures of 20,000-40,000 K. Detection is challenging as the white dwarf is often embedded within the Be star's decretion disk, absorbing most extreme-UV and soft X-ray photons.\nSome studies suggest that γ Cas stars, a subgroup of Be stars exhibiting bright X-ray emission, likely have white dwarf companions rather than hot subdwarf stars or main sequence stars, as interferometric observations show no detectable companion flux while the systems' properties match theoretical predictions for Be+WD binaries.\nDespite theoretical predictions that BeWDs should be 7 times more common than Be-neutron star systems, only 8 have been confirmed as of 2025. According to different numerical models, 40 to 80% of Be stars should have white dwarf companions.\n\nAll identified systems are located in the Magellanic Clouds rather than the Milky Way, possibly due to lower extinction rates allowing easier detection of soft X-rays, or because of the different metallicity of the Magellanic Clouds which may be related to the formation of BeWDs.",

      "title": "Pluto (mythology)",
      "content": "In ancient Greek religion and mythology, Pluto (Ancient Greek: Πλούτων, romanized: Ploútōn) was the ruler of the underworld. The earlier name for the god was Hades, which became more common as the name of the underworld itself. Pluto represents a more positive concept of the god who presides over the afterlife. Ploutōn was frequently conflated with Ploûtos, the Greek god of wealth, because mineral wealth was found underground, and because as a chthonic god Pluto ruled the deep earth that contained the seeds necessary for a bountiful harvest. The name Ploutōn came into widespread usage with the Eleusinian Mysteries, in which Pluto was venerated as both a stern ruler and a loving husband to Persephone. The couple received souls in the afterlife and are invoked together in religious inscriptions, being referred to as Plouton and as Kore respectively. Hades, by contrast, had few temples and religious practices associated with him, and he is portrayed as the dark and violent abductor of Persephone.\nPluto and Hades differ in character, but they are not distinct figures and share two dominant myths. In Greek cosmogony, the god received the rule of the underworld in a three-way division of sovereignty over the world, with his brother Zeus ruling the sky and his other brother Poseidon sovereign over the sea. His central narrative in myth is of him abducting Persephone to be his wife and the queen of his realm. Plouton as the name of the ruler of the underworld first appears in Greek literature of the Classical period, in the works of the Athenian playwrights and of the philosopher Plato, who is the major Greek source on its significance. Under the name Pluto, the god appears in other myths in a secondary role, mostly as the possessor of a quest-object, and especially in the descent of Orpheus or other heroes to the underworld.\nPlūtō ([ˈpluːtoː]; genitive Plūtōnis) is the Latinized form of the Greek Plouton. Pluto's Roman equivalent is Dis Pater, whose name is most often taken to mean \"Rich Father\" and is perhaps a direct translation of Plouton. Pluto was also identified with the obscure Roman Orcus, like Hades the name of both a god of the underworld and the underworld as a place. Pluto (Pluton in French and German, Plutone in Italian) becomes the most common name for the classical ruler of the underworld in subsequent Western literature and other art forms.",

      "title": "Magnetosphere of Jupiter",
      "content": "The magnetosphere of Jupiter is the cavity created in the solar wind by Jupiter's magnetic field. Extending up to seven million kilometers in the Sun's direction and almost to the orbit of Saturn in the opposite direction, Jupiter's magnetosphere is the largest and most powerful of any planetary magnetosphere in the Solar System, and by volume the largest known continuous structure in the Solar System after the heliosphere. Wider and flatter than the Earth's magnetosphere, Jupiter's is stronger by an order of magnitude, while its magnetic moment is roughly 18,000 times larger. The existence of Jupiter's magnetic field was first inferred from observations of radio emissions at the end of the 1950s and was directly observed by the Pioneer 10 spacecraft in 1973.\nJupiter's internal magnetic field is generated by electrical currents in the planet's outer core, which is theorized to be composed of liquid metallic hydrogen. Volcanic eruptions on Jupiter's moon Io eject large amounts of sulfur dioxide gas into space, forming a large torus around the planet. Jupiter's magnetic field forces the torus to rotate with the same angular velocity and direction as the planet. The torus in turn loads the magnetic field with plasma, in the process stretching it into a pancake-like structure called a magnetodisk. In effect, Jupiter's magnetosphere is internally driven, shaped primarily by Io's plasma and its own rotation, rather than by the solar wind as at Earth's magnetosphere. Strong currents in the magnetosphere generate permanent aurorae around the planet's poles and intense variable radio emissions, which means that Jupiter can be thought of as a very weak radio pulsar. Jupiter's aurorae have been observed in almost all parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, including infrared, visible, ultraviolet and soft X-rays.\nThe action of the magnetosphere traps and accelerates particles, producing intense belts of radiation similar to Earth's Van Allen belts, but thousands of times stronger. The interaction of energetic particles with the surfaces of Jupiter's largest moons markedly affects their chemical and physical properties. Those same particles also affect and are affected by the motions of the particles within Jupiter's tenuous planetary ring system. Radiation belts present a significant hazard for spacecraft and potentially to human space travellers.",

It is primarily responsible for space-based operations, space exploration, international space cooperation and the development of related technologies. The agency maintains a constellation of imaging, communications and remote sensing satellites. It operates the GAGAN and IRNSS satellite navigation systems. It has sent three missions to the Moon and one mission to Mars.\nFormerly known as the Indian National Committee for Space Research (INCOSPAR), ISRO was set up in 1962 by the Government of India on the recommendation of scientist Vikram Sarabhai. It was renamed as ISRO in 1969 and was subsumed into the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE). The establishment of ISRO institutionalised space research activities in India. In 1972, the Government set up a Space Commission and the DoS bringing ISRO under its purview. It has since then been managed by the DoS, which also governs various other institutions in the domain of astronomy and space technology.\nISRO built India's first satellite Aryabhata which was launched by the Soviet space agency Interkosmos in 1975. In 1980, it launched the satellite RS-1 on board the indigenously built launch vehicle SLV-3, making India the seventh country to undertake orbital launches. It has subsequently developed various small-lift and medium-lift launch vehicles, enabling the agency to launch various satellites and deep space missions. It is one of the six government space agencies in the world that possess full launch capabilities with the ability to deploy cryogenic engines, launch extraterrestrial missions and artificial satellites. It is also the only one of the four governmental space agencies to have demonstrated unmanned soft landing capabilities.\nISRO's programmes have played a significant role in socio-economic development. It has supported both civilian and military domains in various aspects such as disaster management, telemedicine, navigation and reconnaissance. ISRO's spin-off technologies have also aided in new innovations in engineering and other allied domains.",

All were built in Palmdale, California, by the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania-based Rockwell International company's North American Aircraft Operations branch. The first orbiter, Enterprise, made its maiden flight in 1977. An unpowered glider, it was carried by a modified Boeing 747 airliner called the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft and released for a series of atmospheric test flights and landings. Enterprise was partially disassembled and retired after completion of critical testing. The remaining orbiters were fully operational spacecraft, and were launched vertically as part of the Space Shuttle stack.\nColumbia was the first space-worthy orbiter; it made its inaugural flight in 1981. Challenger, Discovery, and Atlantis followed in 1983, 1984, and 1985 respectively. In 1986, Challenger was destroyed in a disaster shortly after its 10th launch, killing all seven crew members. Endeavour was built as Challenger's successor, and was first launched in 1992. In 2003, Columbia was destroyed during re-entry, leaving just three remaining orbiters. Discovery completed its final flight on March 9, 2011, and Endeavour completed its final flight on June 1, 2011. Atlantis completed the final Shuttle flight, STS-135, on July 21, 2011.\nIn addition to their crews and payloads, the reusable orbiter carried most of the Space Shuttle's liquid-propellant rocket system, but both the liquid hydrogen fuel and the liquid oxygen oxidizer for its three main rocket engines were fed from an external cryogenic propellant tank. Additionally, two reusable solid rocket boosters (SRBs) provided additional thrust for approximately the first two minutes of launch. The orbiters themselves did carry hypergolic propellants for their Reaction Control System (RCS) thrusters and Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS) engines.",

It also aims to provide global mobile broadband. Starlink has been instrumental to SpaceX's growth.\nSpaceX began launching Starlink satellites in 2019. As of May 2025, the constellation consists of over 7,600 mass-produced small satellites in low Earth orbit (LEO) that communicate with designated ground transceivers. Starlink comprises 65% of all active satellites. Nearly 12,000 satellites are planned, with a possible later extension to 34,400. SpaceX announced reaching over 1 million subscribers in December 2022 and 4 million subscribers in September 2024.\nThe SpaceX satellite development facility in Redmond, Washington, houses Starlink research, development, manufacturing, and orbit control facilities. In May 2018, SpaceX estimated the cost of designing, building and deploying the constellation would be at least US$10 billion. Revenues from Starlink in 2022 were reportedly $1.4 billion with a net loss. In May 2024 that year's revenue was expected to reach $6.6 billion but by December the prediction was raised to $7.7 billion. Revenue was then expected to reach $11.8 billion in 2025. Financial statements filed with the Netherlands Chamber of Commerce revealed Starlink 2024 revenue only reached $2.7 billion, about two-thirds short of the latest prediction, for a profit of $72 million.\nStarlink has been extensively used in the Russo-Ukrainian War, a role for which it has been contracted by the United States Department of Defense. Starshield, a military version of Starlink, is designed for government use.\nAstronomers raised concerns about the effect the constellation would have on ground-based astronomy, and how the satellites contribute to an already congested orbital environment. SpaceX has attempted to mitigate astronometric interference concerns with measures to reduce the satellites' brightness during operation. The satellites are equipped with Hall-effect thrusters allowing them to raise their orbit, station-keep, and de-orbit at the end of their lives. They are also designed to autonomously and smoothly avoid collisions based on uplinked tracking data.",

      "content": "A quasar ( KWAY-zar) is an extremely luminous active galactic nucleus (AGN). It is sometimes known as a quasi-stellar object, abbreviated QSO. The emission from an AGN is powered by accretion onto a supermassive black hole with a mass ranging from millions to tens of billions of solar masses, surrounded by a gaseous accretion disc. Gas in the disc falling towards the black hole heats up and releases energy in the form of electromagnetic radiation. The radiant energy of quasars is enormous; the most powerful quasars have luminosities thousands of times greater than that of a galaxy such as the Milky Way. Quasars are usually categorized as a subclass of the more general category of AGN. The redshifts of quasars are of cosmological origin.\nThe term quasar originated as a contraction of \"quasi-stellar [star-like] radio source\"—because they were first identified during the 1950s as sources of radio-wave emission of unknown physical origin—and when identified in photographic images at visible wavelengths, they resembled faint, star-like points of light. High-resolution images of quasars, particularly from the Hubble Space Telescope, have shown that quasars occur in the centers of galaxies, and that some host galaxies are strongly interacting or merging galaxies. As with other categories of AGN, the observed properties of a quasar depend on many factors, including the mass of the black hole, the rate of gas accretion, the orientation of the accretion disc relative to the observer, the presence or absence of a jet, and the degree of obscuration by gas and dust within the host galaxy.\nAbout a million quasars have been identified with reliable spectroscopic redshifts, and between 2-3 million identified in photometric catalogs. The nearest known quasar is about 600 million light-years from Earth, while the record for the most distant known AGN is at a redshift of 10.1, corresponding to a comoving distance of 31.6 billion light-years, or a look-back time of 13.2 billion years.\nQuasar discovery surveys have shown that quasar activity was more common in the distant past; the peak epoch was approximately 10 billion years ago. Concentrations of multiple quasars are known as large quasar groups and may constitute some of the largest known structures in the universe if the observed groups are good tracers of mass distribution.",

      "content": "Starship is a spacecraft and second stage under development by American aerospace company SpaceX. Stacked atop its booster, Super Heavy, the pair compose SpaceX's super heavy-lift space vehicle, also called Starship. The spacecraft is designed to transport both crew and cargo to a variety of destinations, including Earth orbit, the Moon, and Mars. It is designed to be reusable and capable of landing propulsively by firing its engines to perform a controlled descent into the arms of a tower on Earth or with landing legs on other planetary bodies. It is intended to enable long-duration interplanetary flights with a crew of up to 100 people. It is also claimed by SpaceX to be capable of enabling travel to anywhere on Earth in under an hour. Furthermore, it has been proposed to be used to refuel other Starship spacecraft, enabling them to reach higher orbits and other space destinations. Elon Musk, the CEO of SpaceX, estimated in a tweet that eight launches would be needed to completely refuel a Starship in low Earth orbit. However, some estimates include as many as twenty refueling flights.\nDevelopment began in 2012, when Musk described a plan to build a reusable launch vehicle with substantially greater capabilities than the Falcon 9 and the planned Falcon Heavy. The rocket evolved through many design and name changes. On July 25, 2019, the Starhopper prototype performed the first successful flight at SpaceX Starbase near Boca Chica, Texas. In May 2021, the SN15 prototype became the first full-size test spacecraft to take off and land successfully. On April 20, 2023, Starship 24 performed the first full flight test on top of a Super Heavy booster, followed by a second test on November 18, 2023, when Starship 25 successfully completed hot staging and passed the Kármán line, becoming the first Starship to reach space as well as the heaviest object to ever reach space, before exploding at 148 km. As of March 2025, SpaceX has conducted six more flight tests of Starship, successfully achieving orbital velocities and gradually testing the atmospheric reentry and vertical landing capabilities of the vehicle by performing controlled splashdowns into the Indian Ocean. In April 2024, Elon Musk announced two new versions of Starship, Block 2 and Block 3. Both versions are expected to be taller, and have increased thrust.",

Originally a five-piece band, Seungri retired from the entertainment industry in March 2019 and T.O.P left in May 2023. Dubbed the \"Kings of K-pop\", they helped spread the Korean Wave internationally and are considered one of the most influential acts in K-pop. They are known for their trendsetting musical experimentation, self-production, and stage presence.\nAlthough their debut album, BigBang Vol.1 (2006), was released to lukewarm reception, greater success followed with a string of hit singles: \"Lies\", which topped Korean music charts for a record-breaking six consecutive weeks and won Song of the Year at the 2007 Mnet Km Music Festival and the 2008 Seoul Music Awards; \"Last Farewell\", \"Haru Haru\", and \"Sunset Glow\". After winning Artist of the Year at the 2008 Mnet Korean Music Festival and the 2008 Seoul Music Awards, the group released four Japanese studio albums—BigBang (2009), BigBang 2 (2011), Alive (2012), and Made Series (2016)—all of which were certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ).\nAfter a two-year hiatus in South Korea, the quintet returned with their fourth EP, Tonight (2011), which won them the inaugural Best Worldwide Act Award at the 2011 MTV Europe Music Awards. Their fifth EP, Alive (2012), became the first Korean album to chart on the US Billboard 200. Their third studio album, Made (2016), was preceded by several chart-topping singles and won the group Artist of the Year awards at the 2015 Mnet Asian Music Awards for the third time and at the 2015 Melon Music Awards. Its supporting tour, the Made World Tour, attracted 1.5 million people and set a new record for the most-attended concert tour headlined by a Korean act in history at the time.\nEleven of BigBang's singles have reached number one on South Korea's Gaon Digital Chart and have collectively remained atop the Melon charts for a record 51 weeks. Forbes Korea ranked them as one of the most powerful celebrities in South Korea from 2009 to 2016 (placing 2nd in 2009, 2012 and 2014); and they were the first Korean artists to be included on the Forbes Celebrity 100 (2016) and 30 Under 30 list of most influential musicians in the world (2017).",

      "content": "Earth Day is an annual event on April 22 to demonstrate support for environmental protection. First held on April 22, 1970, it now includes a wide range of events coordinated globally through earthday.org (formerly Earth Day Network) including 1 billion people in more than 193 countries.\nIn 1969 at a UNESCO conference in San Francisco, peace activist John McConnell proposed a day to honor the Earth and the concept of peace, to first be observed on March 21, 1970, the first day of spring in the northern hemisphere. This day of nature's equipoise was later sanctioned in a proclamation written by McConnell and signed by Secretary General U Thant at the United Nations. A month later, United States senator Gaylord Nelson proposed the idea to hold a nationwide environmental teach-in on April 22, 1970, and hired a young activist, Denis Hayes, to be the national coordinator. The name \"Earth Day\" was coined by advertising writer Julian Koenig. Denis and his staff grew the event beyond the original idea for a teach-in to include the entire United States. Key non-environmentally focused partners played major roles. Under the leadership of labor leader Walter Reuther, for example, the United Auto Workers (UAW) was the most instrumental outside financial and operational supporter of the first Earth Day. According to Hayes: \"Without the UAW, the first Earth Day would have likely flopped!\" Nelson was later awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom award in recognition of his work. \nThe first Earth Day was focused on the United States. In 1990, Denis Hayes, the original national coordinator in 1970, took it international and organized events in 141 nations. On Earth Day 2016, the landmark Paris Agreement was signed by the United States, the United Kingdom, China, and 120 other countries. This signing satisfied a key requirement for the entry into force of the historic draft climate protection treaty adopted by consensus of the 195 nations present at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris. Numerous communities engaged in \"Earth Day Week actions,\" an entire week of activities focused on the environmental issues that the world faces. On Earth Day 2020, over 100 million people around the world observed the 50th anniversary in what is being referred to as the largest online mass mobilization in history.",

      "content": "The Iowa class was a class of six fast battleships ordered by the United States Navy in 1939 and 1940. They were initially intended to intercept fast capital ships such as the Japanese Kongō class battlecruiser and serve as the \"fast wing\" of the U.S. battle line. The Iowa class was designed to meet the Second London Naval Treaty's \"escalator clause\" limit of 45,000-long-ton (45,700 t) standard displacement. Beginning in August 1942, four vessels, Iowa, New Jersey, Missouri, and Wisconsin, were completed; two more, Illinois and Kentucky, were laid down but canceled in 1945 and 1958, respectively, before completion, and both hulls were scrapped in 1958–1959.\nThe four Iowa-class ships were the last battleships commissioned in the U.S. Navy. All older U.S. battleships were decommissioned by 1947 and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register (NVR) by 1963. Between the mid-1940s and the early 1990s, the Iowa-class battleships fought in four major U.S. wars. In the Pacific Theater of World War II, they served primarily as fast escorts for Essex-class aircraft carriers of the Fast Carrier Task Force and also shelled Japanese positions. During the Korean War, the battleships provided naval gunfire support (NGFS) for United Nations forces, and in 1968, New Jersey shelled Viet Cong and Vietnam People's Army forces in the Vietnam War. All four were reactivated and modernized at the direction of the United States Congress in 1981, and armed with missiles during the 1980s, as part of the 600-ship Navy initiative. During Operation Desert Storm in 1991, Missouri and Wisconsin fired missiles and 16-inch (406 mm) guns at Iraqi targets.\nCostly to maintain, the battleships were decommissioned during the post-Cold War drawdown in the early 1990s. All four were initially removed from the Naval Vessel Register, but the United States Congress compelled the Navy to reinstate two of them on the grounds that existing shore bombardment capability would be inadequate for amphibious operations. This resulted in a lengthy debate over whether battleships should have a role in the modern navy. Ultimately, all four ships were stricken from the Naval Vessel Register and released for donation to non-profit organizations. With the transfer of Iowa in 2012, all four are museum ships part of non-profit maritime museums across the US.",

Each day it features a different image of the universe accompanied by an explanation written by a professional astronomer.\nThe photograph does not necessarily correspond to a celestial event on the exact day that it is displayed, and images are sometimes repeated.\nThese often relate to current events in astronomy and space exploration. The text has several hyperlinks to more pictures and websites for more information. The images are either visible spectrum photographs, images taken at non-visible wavelengths and displayed in false color, video footage, animations, artist's conceptions, or micrographs that relate to space or cosmology.\nPast images are stored in the APOD Archive, with the first image appearing on June 16, 1995. This initiative has received support from NASA, the National Science Foundation, and MTU. The images are sometimes authored by people or organizations outside NASA, and therefore APOD images are often copyrighted, unlike many other NASA image galleries.\nWhen the APOD website was created, it received a total of 14 page views on its first day. As of 2012, the APOD website has received over a billion image views throughout its lifetime. APOD is also translated into 21 languages daily.\nAPOD was presented at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society in 1996. Its practice of using hypertext was analyzed in a paper in 2000. It received a Scientific American Sci/Tech Web Award in 2001. In 2002, the website was featured in an interview with Nemiroff on CNN Saturday Morning News. In 2003, the two authors published a book titled The Universe: 365 Days from Harry N. Abrams, which is a collection of the best images from APOD as a hardcover \"coffee table\" style book. APOD was the Featured Collection in the November 2004 issue of D-Lib Magazine.\nDuring the United States federal government shutdown of 2013, APOD continued its service on mirror sites.\nRobert J. Nemiroff and Jerry T. Bonnell were awarded the 2015 Klumpke-Roberts Award by the Astronomical Society of the Pacific \"for outstanding contributions to public understanding and appreciation of astronomy\" for their work on APOD.

      "content": "Ulaanbaatar is the capital and most populous city of Mongolia. It has a population of 1.6 million, and it is the coldest capital city in the world by average yearly temperature. The municipality is located in north central Mongolia at an elevation of about 1,300 metres (4,300 ft) in a valley on the Tuul River. The city was founded in 1639 as a nomadic Buddhist monastic centre, changing location 29 times, and was permanently settled at its modern location in 1778.\nDuring its early years, as Örgöö (anglicized as Urga), it became Mongolia's preeminent religious centre and seat of the Jebtsundamba Khutuktu, the spiritual head of the Gelug lineage of Tibetan Buddhism in Mongolia. Following the regulation of Qing-Russian trade by the Treaty of Kyakhta in 1727, a caravan route between Beijing and Kyakhta opened up, along which the city was eventually settled. With the collapse of the Qing dynasty in 1911, the city was a focal point for independence efforts, leading to the proclamation of the Bogd Khanate in 1911 led by the 8th Jebtsundamba Khutuktu, or Bogd Khan, and again during the communist revolution of 1921. With the proclamation of the Mongolian People's Republic in 1924, the city was officially renamed Ulaanbaatar and declared the country's capital.\nModern urban planning began in the 1950s, with most of the old ger districts replaced by Soviet-style flats. In 1990, Ulaanbaatar was the site of large demonstrations that led to Mongolia's transition to democracy and a market economy. Since 1990, an influx of migrants from the rest of the country has led to an explosive growth in its population, a major portion of whom live in ger districts, which has contributed to harmful air pollution in winter. Excessive coal production and consumption in Ulaanbaatar make it one of the world's most polluted cities, causing the incidence of pneumonia and other respiratory illnesses to spike amongst children. \nGoverned as an independent municipality, Ulaanbaatar is surrounded by Töv Province, whose capital Zuunmod lies 43 kilometres (27 mi) south of the city. With a population of just over 1.6 million as of December 2022, it contains almost half of the country's total population. As the country's primate city, it serves as its cultural, industrial and financial heart and the centre of its transport network.",

Located one block south of Bryant Park, it was constructed in 1907 along with the adjoining Engineers' Club. The building was designed by Herbert D. Hale, of the firm Hale & Rogers, along with Henry G. Morse, in the neo-Renaissance style. It served as the clubhouse of the United Engineering Societies, composed of its three founding societies: the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), the American Institute of Mining Engineers (AIME), and the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE). The American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) joined the partnership in 1917.\nThe Engineering Societies Building's facade is divided horizontally into three sections. The building was originally thirteen stories tall, excluding the second story, which was not visible from the facade. The lowest three stories comprise a rusticated base of limestone, including a colonnade with Doric columns. Above that is a seven-story stone midsection, followed by another loggia similar to that on the base. Inside, the building's first story contains the lobby. The second story is hidden beneath what was originally a double-tiered auditorium with 1,000 seats. The fifth and sixth stories contained several lecture rooms, and the seventh through eleventh stories contained engineering offices; the twelfth and thirteenth stories were devoted to an engineering library. Two stories were added later.\nThe Engineering Societies' Building was funded by Andrew Carnegie, who in 1904 offered money for a new clubhouse for New York City's various engineering societies. The Engineers' Club did not want to share a building with the other societies, so an architectural design competition was held for two clubhouse buildings. By the 1950s, the Engineering Societies' Building was becoming too small for the engineering societies' needs, and the societies sold the clubhouse in 1960. In the late 20th century, the building was used by fashion firms such as women's clothing retailer Lane Bryant and fashion designer Tommy Hilfiger. The building has been owned by Thor Equities since 2005, and it was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2007.",

      "title": "Earthquake",
      "content": "An earthquake – also called a quake, tremor, or temblor – is the shaking of the Earth's surface resulting from a sudden release of energy in the lithosphere that creates seismic waves. Earthquakes can range in intensity, from those so weak they cannot be felt, to those violent enough to propel objects and people into the air, damage critical infrastructure, and wreak destruction across entire cities. The seismic activity of an area is the frequency, type, and size of earthquakes experienced over a particular time. The seismicity at a particular location in the Earth is the average rate of seismic energy release per unit volume.\nIn its most general sense, the word earthquake is used to describe any seismic event that generates seismic waves. Earthquakes can occur naturally or be induced by human activities, such as mining, fracking, and nuclear weapons testing. The initial point of rupture is called the hypocenter or focus, while the ground level directly above it is the epicenter. Earthquakes are primarily caused by geological faults, but also by volcanism, landslides, and other seismic events.\nSignificant historical earthquakes include the 1556 Shaanxi earthquake in China, with over 830,000 fatalities, and the 1960 Valdivia earthquake in Chile, the largest ever recorded at 9.5 magnitude. Earthquakes result in various effects, such as ground shaking and soil liquefaction, leading to significant damage and loss of life. When the epicenter of a large earthquake is located offshore, the seabed may be displaced sufficiently to cause a tsunami. Earthquakes can trigger landslides. Earthquakes' occurrence is influenced by tectonic movements along faults, including normal, reverse (thrust), and strike-slip faults, with energy release and rupture dynamics governed by the elastic-rebound theory.\nEfforts to manage earthquake risks involve prediction, forecasting, and preparedness, including seismic retrofitting and earthquake engineering to design structures that withstand shaking. The cultural impact of earthquakes spans myths, religious beliefs, and modern media, reflecting their profound influence on human societies. Similar seismic phenomena, known as marsquakes and moonquakes, have been observed on other celestial bodies, indicating the universality of such events beyond Earth.",

      "title": "Cosmic inflation",
      "content": "In physical cosmology, cosmic inflation, cosmological inflation, or just inflation, is a theory of exponential expansion of space in the very early universe. Following the inflationary period, the universe continued to expand, but at a slower rate. The re-acceleration of this slowing expansion due to dark energy began after the universe was already over 7.7 billion years old (5.4 billion years ago).\nInflation theory was developed in the late 1970s and early 1980s, with notable contributions by several theoretical physicists, including Alexei Starobinsky at Landau Institute for Theoretical Physics, Alan Guth at Cornell University, and Andrei Linde at Lebedev Physical Institute. Starobinsky, Guth, and Linde won the 2014 Kavli Prize \"for pioneering the theory of cosmic inflation\". It was developed further in the early 1980s. It explains the origin of the large-scale structure of the cosmos. Quantum fluctuations in the microscopic inflationary region, magnified to cosmic size, become the seeds for the growth of structure in the Universe (see galaxy formation and evolution and structure formation). Many physicists also believe that inflation explains why the universe appears to be the same in all directions (isotropic), why the cosmic microwave background radiation is distributed evenly, why the universe is flat, and why no magnetic monopoles have been observed.\nThe detailed particle physics mechanism responsible for inflation is unknown. A number of inflation model predictions have been confirmed by observation; for example temperature anisotropies observed by the COBE satellite in 1992 exhibit nearly scale-invariant spectra as predicted by the inflationary paradigm and WMAP results also show strong evidence for inflation. However, some scientists dissent from this position. The hypothetical field thought to be responsible for inflation is called the inflaton.\nIn 2002, three of the original architects of the theory were recognized for their major contributions; physicists Alan Guth of M.I.T., Andrei Linde of Stanford, and Paul Steinhardt of Princeton shared the Dirac Prize \"for development of the concept of inflation in cosmology\". In 2012, Guth and Linde were awarded the Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics for their invention and development of inflationary cosmology.",

      "title": "Earth's rotation",
      "content": "Earth's rotation or Earth's spin is the rotation of planet Earth around its own axis, as well as changes in the orientation of the rotation axis in space. Earth rotates eastward, in prograde motion. As viewed from the northern polar star Polaris, Earth turns counterclockwise.\nThe North Pole, also known as the Geographic North Pole or Terrestrial North Pole, is the point in the Northern Hemisphere where Earth's axis of rotation meets its surface. This point is distinct from Earth's north magnetic pole. The South Pole is the other point where Earth's axis of rotation intersects its surface, in Antarctica.\nEarth rotates once in about 24 hours with respect to the Sun, but once every 23 hours, 56 minutes and 4 seconds with respect to other distant stars (see below). Earth's rotation is slowing slightly with time; thus, a day was shorter in the past. This is due to the tidal effects the Moon has on Earth's rotation. Atomic clocks show that the modern day is longer by about 1.7 milliseconds than a century ago, slowly increasing the rate at which UTC is adjusted by leap seconds. Analysis of historical astronomical records shows a slowing trend; the length of a day increased by about 2.3 milliseconds per century since the 8th century BCE.\nScientists reported that in 2020 Earth had started spinning faster, after consistently spinning slower than 86,400 seconds per day in the decades before. On June 29, 2022, Earth's spin was completed in 1.59 milliseconds under 24 hours, setting a new record. Because of that trend, engineers worldwide are discussing a 'negative leap second' and other possible timekeeping measures.\nThis increase in speed is thought to be due to various factors, including the complex motion of its molten core, oceans, and atmosphere, the effect of celestial bodies such as the Moon, and possibly climate change, which is causing the ice at Earth's poles to melt. The masses of ice account for the Earth's shape being that of an oblate spheroid, bulging around the equator. When these masses are reduced, the poles rebound from the loss of weight, and Earth becomes more spherical, which has the effect of bringing mass closer to its centre of gravity. Conservation of angular momentum dictates that a mass distributed more closely around its centre of gravity spins faster.",

      "content": "Thermodynamics is a branch of physics that deals with heat, work, and temperature, and their relation to energy, entropy, and the physical properties of matter and radiation. The behavior of these quantities is governed by the four laws of thermodynamics, which convey a quantitative description using measurable macroscopic physical quantities but may be explained in terms of microscopic constituents by statistical mechanics. Thermodynamics applies to various topics in science and engineering, especially physical chemistry, biochemistry, chemical engineering, and mechanical engineering, as well as other complex fields such as meteorology.\nHistorically, thermodynamics developed out of a desire to increase the efficiency of early steam engines, particularly through the work of French physicist Sadi Carnot (1824) who believed that engine efficiency was the key that could help France win the Napoleonic Wars. Scots-Irish physicist Lord Kelvin was the first to formulate a concise definition of thermodynamics in 1854 which stated, \"Thermo-dynamics is the subject of the relation of heat to forces acting between contiguous parts of bodies, and the relation of heat to electrical agency.\"  German physicist and mathematician Rudolf Clausius restated Carnot's principle known as the Carnot cycle and gave the theory of heat a truer and sounder basis. His most important paper, \"On the Moving Force of Heat\", published in 1850, first stated the second law of thermodynamics. In 1865 he introduced the concept of entropy. In 1870 he introduced the virial theorem, which applied to heat.\nThe initial application of thermodynamics to mechanical heat engines was quickly extended to the study of chemical compounds and chemical reactions. Chemical thermodynamics studies the nature of the role of entropy in the process of chemical reactions and has provided the bulk of expansion and knowledge of the field. Other formulations of thermodynamics emerged. Statistical thermodynamics, or statistical mechanics, concerns itself with statistical predictions of the collective motion of particles from their microscopic behavior. In 1909, Constantin Carathéodory presented a purely mathematical approach in an axiomatic formulation, a description often referred to as geometrical thermodynamics.",

      "content": "Ingenuity, nicknamed Ginny, is an autonomous NASA helicopter that operated on Mars from 2021 to 2024 as part of the Mars 2020 mission. Ingenuity made its first flight on 19 April 2021, demonstrating that flight is possible in the extremely thin atmosphere of Mars, and becoming the first aircraft to conduct a powered and controlled extra-terrestrial flight. It was designed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in collaboration with AeroVironment, NASA's Ames Research Center and Langley Research Center with some components supplied by Lockheed Martin Space, Qualcomm, and SolAero.\nIngenuity was delivered to Mars on 18 February 2021, attached to the underside of the Perseverance rover, which landed at Octavia E. Butler Landing near the western rim of the 45 km-wide (28 mi) Jezero crater. Because radio signals take between five and 20 minutes to travel between Earth and Mars, depending on the planets' positions, it could not be controlled directly in real time but flew autonomously to execute flight plans designed and sent to it by JPL.\nOriginally intended to make only five flights, Ingenuity completed 72 flights in nearly three years. The five planned flights were part of a 30-sol technology demonstration intended to prove its airworthiness with flights of up to 90 seconds at altitudes ranging from 3–5 m (10–16 ft). Following this demonstration, JPL designed a series of operational flights to explore how aerial scouts could help explore Mars and other worlds. In this operational role, Ingenuity scouted areas of interest for the Perseverance rover, improved navigational techniques, and explored the limits of its flight envelope. Ingenuity's performance and resilience in the harsh Martian environment greatly exceeded expectations, allowing it to perform far more flights than were initially planned. On 18 January 2024, the rotor blades were broken during landing on flight 72, permanently grounding the helicopter. NASA announced the end of the mission one week later. Engineers concluded that Ingenuity's navigation system was not effective over the featureless terrain on the final flight,  resulting in a crash landing. Ingenuity had flown for a total of two hours, eight minutes and 48 seconds over 1,004 days, covering more than 17 kilometres (11 mi).",

      "title": "Moons of Jupiter",
      "content": "There are 97 moons of Jupiter with confirmed orbits as of 30 April 2025. This number does not include a number of meter-sized moonlets thought to be shed from the inner moons, nor hundreds of possible kilometer-sized outer irregular moons that were only briefly captured by telescopes. All together, Jupiter's moons form a satellite system called the Jovian system. The most massive of the moons are the four Galilean moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto, which were independently discovered in 1610 by Galileo Galilei and Simon Marius and were the first objects found to orbit a body that was neither Earth nor the Sun. Much more recently, beginning in 1892, dozens of far smaller Jovian moons have been detected and have received the names of lovers (or other sexual partners) or daughters of the Roman god Jupiter or his Greek equivalent Zeus. The Galilean moons are by far the largest and most massive objects to orbit Jupiter, with the remaining 93 known moons and the rings together comprising just 0.003% of the total orbiting mass.\nOf Jupiter's moons, eight are regular satellites with prograde and nearly circular orbits that are not greatly inclined with respect to Jupiter's equatorial plane. The Galilean satellites are nearly spherical in shape due to their planetary mass, and are just massive enough that they would be considered major planets if they were in direct orbit around the Sun. The other four regular satellites, known as the inner moons, are much smaller and closer to Jupiter; these serve as sources of the dust that makes up Jupiter's rings. The remainder of Jupiter's moons are outer irregular satellites whose prograde and retrograde orbits are much farther from Jupiter and have high inclinations and eccentricities. The largest of these moons were likely asteroids that were captured from solar orbits by Jupiter before impacts with other small bodies shattered them into many kilometer-sized fragments, forming collisional families of moons sharing similar orbits. Jupiter is expected to have about 100 irregular moons larger than 1 km (0.6 mi) in diameter, plus around 500 more smaller retrograde moons down to diameters of 0.8 km (0.5 mi). Of the 89 known irregular moons of Jupiter, 40 of them have not yet been officially given names.",

Written by William Emms and directed by Derek Martinus, the serial was broadcast on BBC1 in four weekly parts from 11 September to 2 October 1965. In the serial, the First Doctor (William Hartnell) and his travelling companions Vicki (Maureen O'Brien) and Steven (Peter Purves) arrive on an arid planet, where they encounter the beautiful but dangerous Drahvins and the hideous but friendly Rills, two crash-landed species in conflict with one another. Both species wish to escape as the planet is set to explode in two dawns, but the Drahvin leader Maaga (Stephanie Bidmead) wants only her people to make it out alive.\nEmms, an avid Doctor Who viewer since its beginning, was commissioned to write Galaxy 4 by outgoing story editor Dennis Spooner after submitting an unsolicited story idea: show two conflicting races—one beautiful and one ugly—and flip convention by making the beautiful race evil. Spooner's successor Donald Tosh handled the bulk of the rewrites. Although Verity Lambert was credited as producer, Galaxy 4 was the first serial to be produced by her successor John Wiles. Mervyn Pinfield was originally assigned to direct the story but his failing health shortly into production prevented him from continuing, and he was replaced by Derek Martinus, a new director. Galaxy 4 was the penultimate serial of the show's second recording block but was pushed to open the third season. Filming took place at the Television Centre in July 1965.\nGalaxy 4 received high viewership numbers, with an average of 9.9 million viewers across the four episodes; and the third episode became the most-viewed of the third season with 11 million viewers. Contemporary and retrospective reviews were generally positive, with praise for its concept and originality. The videotapes of the serial were wiped by the BBC in the late 1960s; the third episode was recovered in 2011, but the other three episodes remain missing. Galaxy 4 received print and audiobook adaptations, and was released on VHS and DVD with reconstructions of the missing episodes using telesnaps and off-air recordings; an animated version of the serial has also been released on DVD and Blu-ray.",

      "content": "SpaceX COTS Demo Flight 2 (COTS 2), also known as Dragon C2+, was the second test-flight for SpaceX's uncrewed Cargo Dragon spacecraft. It launched in May 2012 on the third flight of the company's two-stage Falcon 9 launch vehicle. The flight was performed under a funded agreement from NASA as the second Dragon demonstration mission in the Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) program. The purpose of the COTS program is to develop and demonstrate commercial sources for cargo re-supply of the International Space Station (ISS). The Dragon C2+ spacecraft was the first American vehicle to visit the ISS since the end of the Space Shuttle program. It was also the first commercial spacecraft to rendezvous and berth with another spacecraft.\nInitially, the objectives of the C2+ mission were to have been accomplished by two separate missions; Dragon C2 would have carried out a fly-by of the ISS, practiced rendezvous maneuvers and communications with the station, before returning to Earth. A second mission, Dragon C3, would have been the first mission to berth with the station. In July 2011, NASA gave tentative approval to combine the objectives of the two missions. In December 2011, NASA formally approved the merger of the COTS 2 and 3 missions into the Dragon C2+ flight. There were several launch delays, the last one occurring on 19 May 2012, due to a launch abort during the last second before liftoff.\nDragon C2+ successfully launched from Cape Canaveral on 22 May 2012. During the mission's first three days all of the COTS 2 objectives were successfully completed. The mission's COTS 3 phase began on 25 May when Dragon rendezvoused again with the ISS and then was successfully captured using the Canadarm2. It was berthed to the station later that day, using the robotic arm. Dragon stayed for almost six days during which the astronauts unloaded cargo, and then reloaded Dragon with Earth-bound cargo. On 31 May, Dragon unberthed from the ISS, its capsule landed in the Pacific Ocean off the California coast and was recovered. All the objectives of the mission were successfully completed, and the Falcon 9-Dragon system became certified to start regular cargo delivery missions to the ISS under the Commercial Resupply Services program.",

To support continued U.S. leadership in aviation, Congress and NASA requested that the National Research Council undertake a decadal survey of civil aeronautics research and technology (R&T) priorities that would help NASA fulfill its responsibility to preserve U.S. leadership in aeronautics technology. In 2006, the National Research Council published the Decadal Survey of Civil Aeronautics. That report presented a set of six strategic objectives for the next decade of aeronautics R&T, and it described 51 high-priority R&T challenges--characterized by five common themes--for both NASA and non-NASA researchers. The National Research Council produced the present report, which assesses NASA's Aeronautics Research Program, in response to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2005 (Public Law 109-155). This report focuses on three sets of questions: 1. How well does NASA's research portfolio implement appropriate recommendations and address relevant high-priority research and technology challenges identified in the Decadal Survey of Civil Aeronautics? If gaps are found, what steps should be taken by the federal government to eliminate them? 2. How well does NASA's aeronautics research portfolio address the aeronautics research requirements of NASA, particularly for robotic and human space exploration? How well does NASA's aeronautics research portfolio address other federal government department/agency non-civil aeronautics research needs? If gaps are found, what steps should be taken by NASA and/or other parts of the federal government to eliminate them? 3. Will the nation have a skilled research workforce and research facilities commensurate with the requirements in (1) and (2) above? What critical improvements in workforce expertise and research facilities, if any, should NASA and the nation make to achieve the goals of NASA's research program? This report continues the good work begun by the Decadal Survey of Civil Aeronautics, and it expands that work to consider in more depth NASA aeronautics research issues related to the space program, non-civil applications, workforce, and facilities.",

      "title": "Galaxy rotation curve",
      "content": "The rotation curve of a disc galaxy (also called a velocity curve) is a plot of the orbital speeds of visible stars or gas in that galaxy versus their radial distance from that galaxy's centre. It is typically rendered graphically as a plot, and the data observed from each side of a spiral galaxy are generally asymmetric, so that data from each side are averaged to create the curve. A significant discrepancy exists between the experimental curves observed, and a curve derived by applying gravity theory to the matter observed in a galaxy. Theories involving dark matter are the main postulated solutions to account for the variance.\nThe rotational/orbital speeds of galaxies/stars do not follow the rules found in other orbital systems such as stars/planets and planets/moons that have most of their mass at the centre. Stars revolve around their galaxy's centre at equal or increasing speed over a large range of distances.  In contrast, the orbital velocities of planets in planetary systems and moons orbiting planets decline with distance according to Kepler’s third law.  This reflects the mass distributions within those systems.  The mass estimations for galaxies based on the light they emit are far too low to explain the velocity observations.\nThe galaxy rotation problem is the discrepancy between observed galaxy rotation curves and the theoretical prediction, assuming a centrally dominated mass associated with the observed luminous material. When mass profiles of galaxies are calculated from the distribution of stars in spirals and mass-to-light ratios in the stellar disks, they do not match with the masses derived from the observed rotation curves and the law of gravity. A solution to this conundrum is to hypothesize the existence of dark matter and to assume its distribution from the galaxy's center out to its halo. Thus the discrepancy between the two curves can be accounted for by adding a dark matter halo surrounding the galaxy.\nThough dark matter is by far the most accepted explanation of the rotation problem, other proposals have been offered with varying degrees of success. Of the possible alternatives, one of the most notable is modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND), which involves modifying the laws of gravity.",

      "content": "Mathematics and architecture are related, since architecture, like some other arts, uses mathematics for several reasons. Apart from the mathematics needed when engineering buildings, architects use geometry: to define the spatial form of a building; from the Pythagoreans of the sixth century BC onwards, to create architectural forms considered harmonious, and thus to lay out buildings and their surroundings according to mathematical, aesthetic and sometimes religious principles; to decorate buildings with mathematical objects such as tessellations; and to meet environmental goals, such as to minimise wind speeds around the bases of tall buildings.\nIn ancient Egypt, ancient Greece, India, and the Islamic world, buildings including pyramids, temples, mosques, palaces and mausoleums were laid out with specific proportions for religious reasons. In Islamic architecture, geometric shapes and geometric tiling patterns are used to decorate buildings, both inside and outside. Some Hindu temples have a fractal-like structure where parts resemble the whole, conveying a message about the infinite in Hindu cosmology. In Chinese architecture, the tulou of Fujian province are circular, communal defensive structures. In the twenty-first century, mathematical ornamentation is again being used to cover public buildings.\nIn Renaissance architecture, symmetry and proportion were deliberately emphasized by architects such as Leon Battista Alberti, Sebastiano Serlio and Andrea Palladio, influenced by Vitruvius's De architectura from ancient Rome and the arithmetic of the Pythagoreans from ancient Greece.\nAt the end of the nineteenth century, Vladimir Shukhov in Russia and Antoni Gaudí in Barcelona pioneered the use of hyperboloid structures; in the Sagrada Família, Gaudí also incorporated hyperbolic paraboloids, tessellations, catenary arches, catenoids, helicoids, and ruled surfaces. In the twentieth century, styles such as modern architecture and Deconstructivism explored different geometries to achieve desired effects. Minimal surfaces have been exploited in tent-like roof coverings as at Denver International Airport, while Richard Buckminster Fuller pioneered the use of the strong thin-shell structures known as geodesic domes.",

Image differencing software compares a recent image with earlier ones of the same part of the sky, detecting objects that have moved, brightened, or appeared. Those systems usually obtain a few observations per night, which can be linked up into a very preliminary orbit determination. This predicts approximate positions over the next few nights, and follow-ups can then be carried out by any telescope powerful enough to see the newly detected object. Orbit intersection calculations are then carried out by two independent systems, one (Sentry) run by NASA and the other (NEODyS) by ESA.\nCurrent systems only detect an arriving object when several factors are just right, mainly the direction of approach relative to the Sun, the weather, and phase of the Moon. The overall success rate is around 1% and is lower for the smaller objects.  A few near misses by medium-size asteroids have been predicted years in advance, with a tiny chance of striking Earth, and a handful of small impactors have successfully been detected hours in advance. All of the latter struck wilderness or ocean, and hurt no one.  The majority of impacts are by small, undiscovered objects.  They rarely hit a populated area, but can cause widespread damage when they do.  Performance is improving in detecting smaller objects as existing systems are upgraded and new ones come on line, but all current systems have a blind spot around the Sun that can only be overcome by a dedicated space based system or by discovering objects on a previous approach to Earth many years before a potential impact.",

      "content": "The Jupiter trojans, commonly called trojan asteroids or simply trojans, are a large group of asteroids that share the planet Jupiter's orbit around the Sun. Relative to Jupiter, each trojan librates around one of Jupiter's stable Lagrange points: either L4, existing 60° ahead of the planet in its orbit, or L5, 60° behind. Jupiter trojans are distributed in two elongated, curved regions around these Lagrangian points with an average semi-major axis of about 5.2 AU.\nThe first Jupiter trojan discovered, 588 Achilles, was spotted in 1906 by German astronomer Max Wolf. More than 9,800 Jupiter trojans have been found as of May 2021. By convention, they are each named from Greek mythology after a figure of the Trojan War, hence the name \"trojan\". The total number of Jupiter trojans larger than 1 km in diameter is believed to be about 1 million, approximately equal to the number of asteroids larger than 1 km in the asteroid belt. Like main-belt asteroids, Jupiter trojans form families.\nAs of 2004, many Jupiter trojans showed to observational instruments as dark bodies with reddish, featureless spectra. No firm evidence of the presence of water, or any other specific compound on their surface has been obtained, but it is thought that they are coated in tholins, organic polymers formed by the Sun's radiation. The Jupiter trojans' densities (as measured by studying binaries or rotational lightcurves) vary from 0.8 to 2.5 g·cm−3. Jupiter trojans are thought to have been captured into their orbits during the early stages of the Solar System's formation or slightly later, during the migration of giant planets.\nThe term \"Trojan Asteroid\" specifically refers to the asteroids co-orbital with Jupiter, but the general term \"trojan\" is sometimes more generally applied to other small Solar System bodies with similar relationships to larger bodies: Mars trojans, Neptune trojans, Uranus trojans and Earth trojans are known to exist. Temporary Venus trojans and Saturn trojans exist, as well as for 1 Ceres and 4 Vesta. The term \"Trojan asteroid\" is normally understood to specifically mean the Jupiter trojans because the first Trojans were discovered near Jupiter's orbit and Jupiter currently has by far the most known Trojans.",

Synonyms of Space/In-space manufacturing are In-orbit manufacturing (since most production capabilities are limited to low Earth orbit), Off-Earth manufacturing, Space-based manufacturing, Orbital manufacturing, In-situ manufacturing, In-space fabrication, In-space production, etc. In-space manufacturing is a part of the broader activity of in-space servicing, assembly and manufacturing (ISAM) and is related to in situ resource utilization (ISRU).\nThree major domains of In-space manufacturing are ISM for space (space-for-space) where products remain in space, ISM for Earth (space-for-Earth) where goods with improved properties produced in outer-space microgravity are transported back to Earth, and ISM for surface where goods are produced on or sent to surfaces of celestial bodies like the Moon, Mars, and asteroids.\nIn-space manufacturing uses processes such as additive manufacturing (printing a 3D object in successive layers), subtractive manufacturing (making 3D objects by successively removing material from a solid), hybrid manufacturing (usually combining additive\nmanufacturing and subtractive manufacturing) and welding (joining pieces of material by melting or plasticizing along a joint line).\nIn-space manufacturing removes spacecraft design limitations due to launch parameters (mass, vibration, structural load, etc.) and volume limitations imposed by payload size. It allows for recycling of launched materials, utilization space-mined resources and on-demand spare parts production, which enables on-site repair of critical parts (increasing reliability and redundancy) and infrastructure development. It takes advantage of unique space features such as microgravity, ultra-vacuum and containerless processing, which are difficult to do on Earth.",

After Voyager 1 successfully completed its flyby of Saturn and its moon Titan, it was decided to send Voyager 2 on flybys of Uranus and Neptune. \nAfter the planetary flybys were complete, decisions were made to keep the probes in operation to explore interstellar space and the outer regions of the Solar System. On 25 August 2012, data from Voyager 1 indicated that it had entered interstellar space. On 5 November 2019, data from Voyager 2 indicated that it also had entered interstellar space. On 4 November 2019, scientists reported that on 5 November 2018, the Voyager 2 probe had officially reached the interstellar medium (ISM), a region of outer space beyond the influence of the solar wind, as did Voyager 1 in 2012. In August 2018, NASA confirmed, based on results by the New Horizons spacecraft, the existence of a \"hydrogen wall\" at the outer edges of the Solar System that was first detected in 1992 by the two Voyager spacecraft.\nAs of 2024, the Voyagers are still in operation beyond the outer boundary of the heliosphere in interstellar space. Voyager 1 is moving with a velocity of 61,198 kilometers per hour (38,027 mph), or 17 km/s, (10.5 miles/second) relative to the Sun, and is 24,475,900,000 kilometers (1.52086×1010 mi) from the Sun reaching a distance of 162 AU (24.2 billion km; 15.1 billion mi) from Earth as of May 25, 2024. As of 2024, Voyager 2 is moving with a velocity of 55,347 kilometers per hour (34,391 mph), or 15 km/s, relative to the Sun, and is 20,439,100,000 kilometers (1.27003×1010 mi) from the Sun reaching a distance of 136.627 AU (20.4 billion km; 12.7 billion mi) from Earth as of May 25, 2024. \nThe two Voyagers are the only human-made objects to date that have passed into interstellar space — a record they will hold until at least the 2040s — and Voyager 1 is the farthest human-made object from Earth.",

      "content": "Earth's magnetic field, also known as the geomagnetic field, is the magnetic field that extends from Earth's interior out into space, where it interacts with the solar wind, a stream of       charged particles emanating from the Sun. The magnetic field is generated by electric currents due to the motion of convection currents of a mixture of molten iron and nickel in Earth's outer core: these convection currents are caused by heat escaping from the core, a natural process called a geodynamo.\nThe magnitude of Earth's magnetic field  at its surface ranges from 25 to 65 μT (0.25 to 0.65 G). As an approximation, it is represented by a field of a magnetic dipole currently tilted at an angle of about 11° with respect to Earth's rotational axis, as if there were an enormous bar magnet placed at that angle through the center of Earth. The North geomagnetic pole (Ellesmere Island, Nunavut, Canada) actually represents the South pole of Earth's magnetic field, and conversely the South geomagnetic pole corresponds to the north pole of Earth's magnetic field (because opposite magnetic poles attract and the north end of a magnet, like a compass needle, points toward Earth's South magnetic field.)\nWhile the North and South magnetic poles are usually located near the geographic poles, they slowly and continuously move over geological time scales, but sufficiently slowly for ordinary compasses to remain useful for navigation. However, at irregular intervals averaging several hundred thousand years, Earth's field reverses and the North and South Magnetic Poles abruptly switch places. These reversals of the geomagnetic poles leave a record in rocks that are of value to paleomagnetists in calculating geomagnetic fields in the past. Such information in turn is helpful in studying the motions of continents and ocean floors. The magnetosphere is defined by the extent of Earth's magnetic field in space or geospace. It extends above the ionosphere, several tens of thousands of kilometres into space, protecting Earth from the charged particles of the solar wind and cosmic rays that would otherwise strip away the upper atmosphere, including the ozone layer that protects Earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation.",

      "title": "Materials science in science fiction",
      "content": "Materials science in science fiction is the study of how materials science is portrayed in works of science fiction. The accuracy of the materials science portrayed spans a wide range – sometimes it is an extrapolation of existing technology, sometimes it is a physically realistic portrayal of a far-out technology, and sometimes it is simply a plot device that looks scientific, but has no basis in science. Examples are:\n\nRealistic: In 1944, the science fiction story \"Deadline\" by Cleve Cartmill depicted the atomic bomb. The properties of various radioactive isotopes are critical to the proposed device, and the plot. This technology was real, unknown to the author.\nExtrapolation: In the 1979 novel The Fountains of Paradise, Arthur C. Clarke wrote about space elevators – basically long cables extending from the Earth's surface to geosynchronous orbit. These require a material with enormous tensile strength and light weight. Carbon nanotubes are strong enough in theory, so the idea is plausible; while one cannot be built today, it violates no physical principles.\nPlot device: An example of an unsupported plot device is scrith, the material used to construct Ringworld, in the novels by Larry Niven. Scrith has unreasonable strength, and is unsupported by known physics, but needed for the plot.\nCritical analysis of materials science in science fiction falls into the same general categories. The predictive aspects are emphasized, for example, in the motto of the Georgia Tech's department of materials science and engineering – Materials scientists lead the way in turning yesterday's science fiction into tomorrow's reality. This is also the theme of many technical articles, such as Material By Design: Future Science or Science Fiction?, found in IEEE Spectrum, the flagship magazine of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.\nOn the other hand, there is criticism of the unrealistic materials science used in science fiction. In the professional materials science journal JOM, for example, there are articles such as The (Mostly Improbable) Materials Science and Engineering of the Star Wars Universe and Personification: The Materials Science and Engineering of Humanoid Robots.",

It is the first full-scale archaeological investigation of human activity in space, studying the International Space Station (ISS) as an archaeological site. It started in 2015. The project's goals are to understand human adaptations to the space environment (especially isolation, confinement, and microgravity), to identify disjunctions between how parts of the space station were designed to be used and how they are actually used, and to show how the social sciences can contribute to improving life in space. ISSAP is led by Justin Walsh (Chapman University) and Alice Gorman (Flinders University).\nThe ISS is an ideal site for archaeological study because it is the first permanent human habitat in space. It has been continuously inhabited since November 2, 2000, and has had almost 300 visitors from more than 20 countries. Although it is not possible for archaeologists to travel directly to the ISS to observe its material culture, the ISSAP team has developed methods that allow it to perform their investigation by proxy, especially the use of historic and directed photography.\nISSAP has published numerous peer-reviewed articles on its research since 2020. The first studies concerned crew-created visual displays, such as a Russian one in the Zvezda module consisting of flags, mission patches, toys, Orthodox icons, and photographs of Russian space heroes such as Yuri Gagarin.\nIn 2018, ISSAP observed the only ISS material culture that returns to Earth, as part of an ethnographic study of the station's cargo-handling processes. The team has experimented with the use of computer vision algorithms to identify crew members, locations in the space station, and objects in tens of thousands of historic photos of the ISS interior. They have also used metadata in the form of captions published by NASA along with historic photos on the image-hosting site Flickr to identify the distribution of different groups of people (men/women, people of different nationalities, and people affiliated with different space agencies) across the various ISS modules.",

Before his presidency, he served as the senior secretary for civil affairs and the chief of staff to President Roh Moo-hyun, a member of the National Assembly, and the Leader of the Democratic Party of Korea.\nBorn to North Korean refugees, Moon was raised in poverty in Busan. He excelled in school and studied law at Kyung Hee University. He became a lawyer and was involved in human rights activism with Roh Moo-hyun. He was imprisoned for organizing a protest against the Yushin Constitution. As a result of his work in human rights law, Moon was chosen to be Roh's campaign manager in the 2002 presidential election. He served in Roh's administration in various official capacities. In 2012, Moon was a candidate for the Democratic United Party in the 2012 presidential election, which he lost to Park Geun-hye.\nIn the 2017 presidential election, Moon was elected president as the Democratic Party of Korea candidate after Park Geun-hye was impeached and removed from office. As president, Moon received international attention for his meetings with North Korean Chairman Kim Jong Un at inter-Korean summits in April, May, and September 2018, making him the third South Korean president to meet their North Korean counterpart. On June 30, 2019, he met with both Kim and US president Donald Trump at the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). During his presidency, Moon favored the Sunshine Policy, a peaceful approach to Korean reunification. On economic policy, he favored reform of chaebols (conglomerates), raised the minimum wage by more than 16%, and lowered the maximum workweek from 68 to 52 hours. During the COVID-19 pandemic in South Korea, Moon received praise domestically and internationally. His party won a historic victory in the 2020 South Korean legislative election. However, his party lost the next presidential election, making him the first president since South Korea's democratization in 1987 to transfer power to the opposition after a single term. He left office in May 2022, succeeded by his former prosecutor general, Yoon Suk Yeol.",

      "content": "Falcon 9 is a partially reusable, two-stage-to-orbit, medium-lift launch vehicle designed and manufactured in the United States by SpaceX. The first Falcon 9 launch was on June 4, 2010, and the first commercial resupply mission to the International Space Station (ISS) launched on October 8, 2012. In 2020, it became the first commercial rocket to launch humans to orbit. The Falcon 9 has been noted for its reliability and high launch cadence, with 506 successful launches, two in-flight failures, one partial failure and one pre-flight destruction. It is the most-launched American orbital rocket in history.\nThe rocket has two stages. The first (booster) stage carries the second stage and payload to a predetermined speed and altitude, after which the second stage accelerates the payload to its target orbit. The booster is capable of landing vertically to facilitate reuse. This feat was first achieved on flight 20 in December 2015. As of July 27, 2025, SpaceX has successfully landed Falcon 9 boosters 465 times. Individual boosters have flown as many as 29 flights. Both stages are powered by SpaceX Merlin engines, using cryogenic liquid oxygen and rocket-grade kerosene (RP-1) as propellants.\nThe heaviest payloads flown to geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) were Intelsat 35e carrying 6,761 kg (14,905 lb), and Telstar 19V with 7,075 kg (15,598 lb). The former was launched into an advantageous super-synchronous transfer orbit, while the latter went into a lower-energy GTO, with an apogee well below the geostationary altitude. On January 24, 2021, Falcon 9 set a record for the most satellites launched by a single rocket, carrying 143 into orbit.\nFalcon 9 is human-rated for transporting NASA astronauts to the ISS, certified for the National Security Space Launch program and the NASA Launch Services Program lists it as a \"Category 3\" (Low Risk) launch vehicle allowing it to launch the agency's most expensive, important, and complex missions.\n\nSeveral versions of Falcon 9 have been built and flown: v1.0 flew from 2010 to 2013, v1.1 flew from 2013 to 2016, while v1.2 Full Thrust first launched in 2015, encompassing the Block 5 variant, which has been in operation since May 2018.",

A sequel to 2008's Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars, Rocket League features up to eight players assigned to each of the two teams, using \"rocket-powered\" vehicles to hit a ball into their opponent's goal and score points over the course of a match. The game includes single-player and multiplayer modes that can be played both locally and online, including cross-platform play between all versions.\nPsyonix began formal development of Rocket League around 2013, refining the gameplay from Battle-Cars to address criticism and fan input. Psyonix also recognized their lack of marketing from Battle-Cars and engaged in both social media and promotions to market the game. Rocket League was first released on the PlayStation Store and Steam for PlayStation 4 and Windows respectively in July 2015, with ports for Xbox One and Nintendo Switch being released later on. Physical retail versions for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One were distributed starting in 2016 by 505 Games and later by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment. Versions for macOS and Linux were also released in 2016, but support for their online services was dropped in 2020. Rocket League is developed under the games as a service model; later updates for the game enabled the ability to modify core rules and added new game modes, including ones based on ice hockey, gridiron football and basketball. It has been offered as free-to-play since 2020 when Epic Games acquired Psyonix.\nRocket League was praised for its gameplay improvements over Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket Powered Battle-Cars, as well as its graphics and overall presentation, although some criticism was directed towards the game's physics engine. It has since been considered one of the greatest video games ever made. The game earned many industry awards and saw over 10 million sales and 40 million players by the beginning of 2018. Rocket League has also been adopted as an esport, with professional players participating through ESL and Major League Gaming along with Psyonix's own Rocket League Championship Series (RLCS).",

Depending on the mass of the star, its lifetime can range from a few million years for the most massive to trillions of years for the least massive, which is considerably longer than the current age of the universe. The table shows the lifetimes of stars as a function of their masses. All stars are formed from collapsing clouds of gas and dust, often called nebulae or molecular clouds.  Over the course of millions of years, these protostars settle down into a state of equilibrium, becoming what is known as a main sequence star.\nNuclear fusion powers a star for most of its existence. Initially the energy is generated by the fusion of hydrogen atoms at the core of the main-sequence star. Later, as the preponderance of atoms at the core becomes helium, stars like the Sun begin to fuse hydrogen along a spherical shell surrounding the core. This process causes the star to gradually grow in size, passing through the subgiant stage until it reaches the red-giant phase. Stars with at least half the mass of the Sun can also begin to generate energy through the fusion of helium at their core, whereas more-massive stars can fuse heavier elements along a series of concentric shells. Once a star like the Sun has exhausted its nuclear fuel, its core collapses into a dense white dwarf and the outer layers are expelled as a planetary nebula. Stars with around ten or more times the mass of the Sun can explode in a supernova as their inert iron cores collapse into an extremely dense neutron star or black hole. Although the universe is not old enough for any of the smallest red dwarfs to have reached the end of their existence, stellar models suggest they will slowly become brighter and hotter before running out of hydrogen fuel and becoming low-mass white dwarfs.\nStellar evolution is not studied by observing the life of a single star, as most stellar changes occur too slowly to be detected, even over many centuries. Instead, astrophysicists come to understand how stars evolve by observing numerous stars at various points in their lifetime, and by simulating stellar structure using computer models.",

      "title": "SpaceX Starship design history",
      "content": "Before settling on the 2018 Starship design, SpaceX successively presented a number of reusable super-heavy lift vehicle proposals. These preliminary spacecraft designs were known under various names (Mars Colonial Transporter, Interplanetary Transport System, BFR).\nIn November 2005, before SpaceX had launched its first rocket, the Falcon 1, CEO Elon Musk first mentioned a high-capacity rocket concept able to launch 100 t (220,000 lb) to low Earth orbit, dubbed the BFR. Later in 2012, Elon Musk first publicly announced plans to develop a rocket surpassing the capabilities of the existing Falcon 9. SpaceX called it the Mars Colonial Transporter, as the rocket was to transport humans to Mars and back. In 2016, the name was changed to Interplanetary Transport System, as the rocket was planned to travel beyond Mars as well. The design called for a carbon fiber structure, a mass in excess of 10,000 t (22,000,000 lb) when fully-fueled, a payload of 300 t (660,000 lb) to low Earth orbit while being fully reusable. By 2017, the concept was temporarily re-dubbed the BFR.\nIn December 2018, the structural material was changed from carbon composites to stainless steel, marking the transition from early design concepts of the Starship. Musk cited numerous reasons for the design change; low cost, ease of manufacture, increased strength of stainless steel at cryogenic temperatures, and ability to withstand high temperatures. In 2019, SpaceX began to refer to the entire vehicle as Starship, with the second stage being called Starship and the booster Super Heavy. They also announced that Starship would use reusable heat shield tiles similar to those of the Space Shuttle. The second-stage design had also settled on six Raptor engines by 2019; three optimized for sea-level and three optimized for vacuum. In 2019 SpaceX announced a change to the second stage's design, reducing the number of aft flaps from three to two to reduce weight. In March 2020, SpaceX released a Starship Users Guide, in which they stated the payload of Starship to low Earth orbit (LEO) would be in excess of 100 t (220,000 lb), with a payload to geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) of 21 t (46,000 lb).",

Spacecraft are used for a variety of purposes, including communications, Earth observation, meteorology, navigation, space colonization, planetary exploration, and transportation of humans and cargo. All spacecraft except single-stage-to-orbit vehicles cannot get into space on their own, and require a launch vehicle (carrier rocket).\nOn a sub-orbital spaceflight, a space vehicle enters space and then returns to the surface without having gained sufficient energy or velocity to make a full Earth orbit. For orbital spaceflights, spacecraft enter closed orbits around the Earth or around other celestial bodies. Spacecraft used for human spaceflight carry people on board as crew or passengers from start or on orbit (space stations) only, whereas those used for robotic space missions operate either autonomously or telerobotically. Robotic spacecraft used to support scientific research are space probes. Robotic spacecraft that remain in orbit around a planetary body are artificial satellites. To date, only a handful of interstellar probes, such as Pioneer 10 and 11, Voyager 1 and 2, and New Horizons, are on trajectories that leave the Solar System.\nOrbital spacecraft may be recoverable or not. Most are not.  Recoverable spacecraft may be subdivided by a method of reentry to Earth into non-winged space capsules and winged spaceplanes. Recoverable spacecraft may be reusable (can be launched again or several times, like the SpaceX Dragon and the Space Shuttle orbiters) or expendable (like the Soyuz). In recent years, more space agencies are tending towards reusable spacecraft.\nHumanity has achieved space flight, but only a few nations have the technology for orbital launches: Russia (Roscosmos), the United States (NASA), the member states of the European Space Agency, Japan (JAXA), China (CNSA), India (ISRO), Taiwan (TSA), Israel (ISA), Iran (ISA), and North Korea (NADA). In addition, several private companies have developed or are developing the technology for orbital launches independently from government agencies. Two prominent examples of such companies are SpaceX and Blue Origin.",

      "content": "In physical cosmology and astronomy, dark energy is a proposed form of energy that affects the universe on the largest scales. Its primary effect is to drive the accelerating expansion of the universe. It also slows the rate of structure formation. Assuming that the lambda-CDM model of cosmology is correct, dark energy dominates the universe, contributing 68% of the total energy in the present-day observable universe while dark matter and ordinary (baryonic) matter contribute 27% and 5%, respectively, and other components such as neutrinos and photons are nearly negligible. Dark energy's density is very low: 7×10−30 g/cm3 (6×10−10 J/m3 in mass-energy), much less than the density of ordinary matter or dark matter within galaxies. However, it dominates the universe's mass–energy content because it is uniform across space.\nThe first observational evidence for dark energy's existence came from measurements of supernovae. Type Ia supernovae have constant luminosity, which means that they can be used as accurate distance measures. Comparing this distance to the redshift (which measures the speed at which the supernova is receding) shows that the universe's expansion is accelerating. Prior to this observation, scientists thought that the gravitational attraction of matter and energy in the universe would cause the universe's expansion to slow over time. Since the discovery of accelerating expansion, several independent lines of evidence have been discovered that support the existence of dark energy.\nThe exact nature of dark energy remains a mystery, and many possible explanations have been theorized. The main candidates are a cosmological constant (representing a constant energy density filling space homogeneously) and scalar fields (dynamic quantities having energy densities that vary in time and space) such as quintessence or moduli. A cosmological constant would remain constant across time and space, while scalar fields can vary. Yet other possibilities are interacting dark energy (see the section Dark energy § Theories of dark energy) an observational effect, cosmological coupling and shockwave cosmology (see the section § Alternatives to dark energy).",

      "content": "Christopher Comstock (born May 19, 1992), known professionally as Marshmello, is an American DJ and record producer. His songs \"Silence\" (featuring Khalid), \"Wolves\" (with Selena Gomez), \"Friends\" (with Anne-Marie), \"Happier\" (with Bastille), and \"Alone\" have each received multi-platinum certifications in several countries, and peaked within the top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100. His musical style includes groove-oriented, synth and bass-heavy electronic dance music.\nMarshmello first gained recognition in early 2015 from publishing remixes online. His debut studio album, Joytime (2016), included  Marshmello's debut commercial single, \"Keep It Mello\". Released in May of that year by indie label Monstercat, his single \"Alone\", peaked at number 28 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and received quintuple platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). In 2017, after releasing the singles \"Chasing Colors\", \"Twinbow\" and \"Moving On\", Marshmello collaborated with R&B singer Khalid to release the single \"Silence\", which received platinum or multi-platinum certifications in eight countries. Later that year, he saw similar success with his collaborative single with singer Selena Gomez, \"Wolves\".\nIn 2018, he released \"Friends\", a collaboration with British singer Anne-Marie. Months later, his second studio album, Joytime II (2018), was supported by the singles \"Tell Me\" and \"Check This Out\". \"Happier\", a collaboration with British band Bastille, was released that August and became his highest-charting song on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number two. In 2019, he earned US$40 million, ranking second on the list of highest paid DJs compiled by Forbes. In 2020, he and American rapper Juice Wrld released \"Come & Go\", from the latter's posthumous album Legends Never Die; the song matched \"Happier\" on the Billboard Hot 100. In 2021, his fourth album, Shockwave earned him a Grammy nomination.\nMarshmello wears a custom white helmet, resembling a marshmallow, for public appearances and in his music videos. His identity was initially unknown to the general public, but Marshmello was confirmed to be Comstock by Forbes in April 2017.",

      "content": "A rocket (from Italian: rocchetto, lit. ''bobbin/spool'', and so named for its shape) is a vehicle that uses jet propulsion to accelerate without using any surrounding air. A rocket engine produces thrust by reaction to exhaust expelled at high speed. Rocket engines work entirely from propellant carried within the vehicle; therefore a rocket can fly in the vacuum of space. Rockets work more efficiently in a vacuum and incur a loss of thrust due to the opposing pressure of the atmosphere.\nMultistage rockets are capable of attaining escape velocity from Earth and therefore can achieve unlimited maximum altitude. Compared with airbreathing engines, rockets are lightweight and powerful and capable of generating large accelerations. To control their flight, rockets rely on momentum, airfoils, auxiliary reaction engines, gimballed thrust, momentum wheels, deflection of the exhaust stream, propellant flow, spin, or gravity.\nRockets for military and recreational uses date back to at least 13th-century China. Significant scientific, interplanetary and industrial use did not occur until the 20th century, when rocketry was the enabling technology for the Space Age, including setting foot on the Moon. Rockets are now used for fireworks, missiles and other weaponry, ejection seats, launch vehicles for artificial satellites, human spaceflight, and space exploration.\nChemical rockets are the most common type of high power rocket, typically creating a high speed exhaust by the combustion of fuel with an oxidizer. The stored propellant can be a simple pressurized gas or a single liquid fuel that disassociates in the presence of a catalyst (monopropellant), two liquids that spontaneously react on contact (hypergolic propellants), two liquids that must be ignited to react (like kerosene (RP1) and liquid oxygen, used in most liquid-propellant rockets), a solid combination of fuel with oxidizer (solid fuel), or solid fuel with liquid or gaseous oxidizer (hybrid propellant system). Chemical rockets store a large amount of energy in an easily released form, and can be very dangerous. However, careful design, testing, construction and use minimizes risks.",

      "content": "A nebula (Latin for 'cloud, fog'; pl. nebulae or nebulas) is a distinct luminescent part of interstellar medium, which can consist of ionized, neutral, or molecular hydrogen and also cosmic dust. Nebulae are often star-forming regions, such as in the Pillars of Creation in the Eagle Nebula. In these regions, the formations of gas, dust, and other materials \"clump\" together to form denser regions, which attract further matter and eventually become dense enough to form stars. The remaining material is then thought to form planets and other planetary system objects. \nMost nebulae are of vast size; some are hundreds of light-years in diameter. A nebula that is visible to the human eye from Earth would appear larger, but no brighter, from close by. The Orion Nebula, the brightest nebula in the sky and occupying an area twice the angular diameter of the full Moon, can be viewed with the naked eye but was missed by early astronomers. Although denser than the space surrounding them, most nebulae are far less dense than any vacuum created on Earth (105 to 107 molecules per cubic centimeter) – a nebular cloud the size of the Earth would have a total mass of only a few kilograms. Earth's air has a density of approximately 1019 molecules per cubic centimeter; by contrast, the densest nebulae can have densities of 104 molecules per cubic centimeter. Many nebulae are visible due to fluorescence caused by embedded hot stars, while others are so diffused that they can be detected only with long exposures and special filters. Some nebulae are variably illuminated by T Tauri variable stars.\nOriginally, the term \"nebula\" was used to describe any diffused astronomical object, including galaxies beyond the Milky Way. The Andromeda Galaxy, for instance, was once referred to as the Andromeda Nebula (and spiral galaxies in general as \"spiral nebulae\") before the true nature of galaxies was confirmed in the early 20th century by Vesto Slipher, Edwin Hubble, and others. Edwin Hubble discovered that most nebulae are associated with stars and illuminated by starlight. He also helped categorize nebulae based on the type of light spectra they produced.",

It was played between the hosting United States and the Soviet Union on February 22, 1980, during the medal round of the men's ice hockey tournament. Although the Soviet Union was a four-time defending gold medalist and heavily favored, the United States achieved an upset victory, winning 4–3.\nThe Soviet Union had won the gold medal in five of the six previous Winter Olympic Games, and they were the favorite to win once more in Lake Placid. The Soviet team consisted of professional players with significant experience in international play. By contrast, the United States team, led by head coach Herb Brooks, was composed mostly of amateur players, with only four players with minimal minor-league experience. In addition, the United States had the youngest team in the tournament and in U.S. national team history. In the group stage, both the Soviet and American teams were undefeated; the U.S. achieved several surprising results, including a 2–2 draw against Sweden, and a 7–3 upset victory over second-place favorite Czechoslovakia.\nFor the first game in the medal round, the Americans played the Soviets. Finishing the first period tied at 2–2, and the Soviets leading 3–2 following the second, the U.S. team scored two more goals to take their first lead midway in the third and final period, then held out to win by a score of 4–3. Two days later, the U.S. secured the gold medal by defeating Finland 4–2 in their final game, while the Soviet Union claimed the silver medal with a dominant 9–2 victory over Sweden.\nThe victory became one of the most iconic moments of the Games and in U.S. sports. Equally well-known was the television call of the final seconds of the game by Al Michaels for ABC, in which he declared: \"Do you believe in miracles? Yes!\" In 1999, Sports Illustrated named the \"Miracle on Ice\" the top sports moment of the 20th century. As part of its centennial celebration in 2008, the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) named the \"Miracle on Ice\" as the top international ice hockey story of the past 100 years.",

      "content": "Pluto (minor-planet designation: 134340 Pluto) is a dwarf planet in the Kuiper belt, a ring of bodies beyond the orbit of Neptune. It is the ninth-largest and tenth-most-massive known object to directly orbit the Sun. It is the largest known trans-Neptunian object by volume by a small margin, but is less massive than Eris. Like other Kuiper belt objects, Pluto is made primarily of ice and rock and is much smaller than the inner planets. Pluto has roughly one-sixth the mass of the Moon and one-third its volume. Originally considered a planet, its classification was changed when astronomers adopted a new definition of planet.\nPluto has a moderately eccentric and inclined orbit, ranging from 30 to 49 astronomical units (4.5 to 7.3 billion kilometres; 2.8 to 4.6 billion miles) from the Sun. Light from the Sun takes 5.5 hours to reach Pluto at its orbital distance of 39.5 AU (5.91 billion km; 3.67 billion mi). Pluto's eccentric orbit periodically brings it closer to the Sun than Neptune, but a stable orbital resonance prevents them from colliding.\nPluto has five known moons: Charon, the largest, whose diameter is just over half that of Pluto; Styx; Nix; Kerberos; and Hydra. Pluto and Charon are sometimes considered a binary system because the barycenter of their orbits does not lie within either body, and they are tidally locked. New Horizons was the first spacecraft to visit Pluto and its moons, making a flyby on July 14, 2015, and taking detailed measurements and observations.\nPluto was discovered in 1930 by Clyde W. Tombaugh, making it the first known object in the Kuiper belt. It was immediately hailed as the ninth planet. However, its planetary status was questioned when it was found to be much smaller than expected. These doubts increased following the discovery of additional objects in the Kuiper belt starting in the 1990s, particularly the more massive scattered disk object Eris in 2005. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) formally redefined the term planet to exclude dwarf planets such as Pluto. Many planetary astronomers, however, continue to consider Pluto and other dwarf planets to be planets.",

      "content": "On Saturday, February 1, 2003, Space Shuttle Columbia disintegrated as it re-entered the atmosphere over Texas and Louisiana, killing all seven astronauts on board. It was the second and last Space Shuttle mission to end in disaster, after the loss of Challenger and crew in 1986.\nThe mission, designated STS-107, was the twenty-eighth flight for the orbiter, the 113th flight of the Space Shuttle fleet and the 88th after the Challenger disaster. It was dedicated to research in various fields, mainly on board the SpaceHab module inside the shuttle's payload bay. During launch, a piece of the insulating foam broke off from the Space Shuttle external tank and struck the thermal protection system tiles on the orbiter's left wing. Similar foam shedding had occurred during previous Space Shuttle launches, causing damage that ranged from minor to near-catastrophic, but some engineers suspected that the damage to Columbia was more serious. Before reentry, NASA managers limited the investigation, reasoning that the crew could not have fixed the problem if it had been confirmed. When Columbia reentered the atmosphere of Earth, the damage allowed hot atmospheric gases to penetrate the heat shield and destroy the internal wing structure, which caused the orbiter to become unstable and break apart.\nAfter the disaster, Space Shuttle flight operations were suspended for more than two years, as they had been after the Challenger disaster. Construction of the International Space Station (ISS) was paused until flights resumed in July 2005 with STS-114. NASA made several technical and organizational changes to subsequent missions, including adding an on-orbit inspection to determine how well the orbiter's thermal protection system (TPS) had endured the ascent, and keeping designated rescue missions ready in case irreparable damage was found. Except for one mission to repair the Hubble Space Telescope, subsequent Space Shuttle missions were flown only to the ISS to allow the crew to use it as a haven if damage to the orbiter prevented safe reentry. The remaining three orbiters were retired after the building of the ISS was completed.",

      "content": "Quantum mechanics is the fundamental physical theory that describes the behavior of matter and of light; its unusual characteristics typically occur at and below the scale of atoms. It is the foundation of all quantum physics, which includes quantum chemistry, quantum field theory, quantum technology, and quantum information science.\nQuantum mechanics can describe many systems that classical physics cannot. Classical physics can describe many aspects of nature at an ordinary (macroscopic and (optical) microscopic) scale, but is not sufficient for describing them at very small submicroscopic (atomic and subatomic) scales. Classical mechanics can be derived from quantum mechanics as an approximation that is valid at ordinary scales.\nQuantum systems have bound states that are quantized to discrete values of energy, momentum, angular momentum, and other quantities, in contrast to classical systems where these quantities can be measured continuously. Measurements of quantum systems show characteristics of both particles and waves (wave–particle duality), and there are limits to how accurately the value of a physical quantity can be predicted prior to its measurement, given a complete set of initial conditions (the uncertainty principle).\nQuantum mechanics arose gradually from theories to explain observations that could not be reconciled with classical physics, such as Max Planck's solution in 1900 to the black-body radiation problem, and the correspondence between energy and frequency in Albert Einstein's 1905 paper, which explained the photoelectric effect. These early attempts to understand microscopic phenomena, now known as the \"old quantum theory\", led to the full development of quantum mechanics in the mid-1920s by Niels Bohr, Erwin Schrödinger, Werner Heisenberg, Max Born, Paul Dirac and others. The modern theory is formulated in various specially developed mathematical formalisms. In one of them, a mathematical entity called the wave function provides information, in the form of probability amplitudes, about what measurements of a particle's energy, momentum, and other physical properties may yield.",

The Comet Line helped Allied soldiers and airmen shot down over occupied Belgium evade capture by Germans and return to Great Britain. The Comet Line began in Brussels where the airmen were fed, clothed, given false identity papers, and hidden in attics, cellars, and people's homes. A network of volunteers then escorted them south through occupied France into neutral Spain and home via British-controlled Gibraltar. The motto of the Comet Line was \"Pugna Quin Percutias\", which means \"fight without arms\", as the organization did not undertake armed or violent resistance to the German occupation.\nThe Comet Line was the largest of several escape networks in occupied Europe. In three years, the Comet Line helped 776 people, mostly British and American airmen, escape to Spain or evade capture in Belgium and France. An estimated 3,000 civilians, mostly Belgians and French, assisted the Comet Line. They are usually called \"helpers\". Seven hundred helpers were arrested by the Germans and 290 were executed or died in prison or concentration camps. The Comet Line maintained its operational independence, but received financial assistance from MI9, a British intelligence agency dedicated to the rescue of Allied prisoners of war and service members from behind enemy lines.\nFor the Allies, the rescue of downed airmen by the Comet and other escape lines had a practical as well as a humanitarian objective.  Training new and replacement air crews was expensive and time-consuming. Rescuing airmen downed in occupied Europe and returning them to duty was a priority. Andrée de Jongh (code named \"Dédée\"), a 24-year-old Belgian woman, was the first leader of the Comet Line. She was imprisoned by the Germans in 1943, but survived the war. Subsequent leaders were also imprisoned, executed, or killed in the course of their work getting airmen to Spain. Young women, including teenagers, played important roles in the Comet Line. Sixty-five to 70 percent of Comet Line helpers were women.",

      "content": "Asteroids have appeared in fiction since at least the late 1800s, the first one—Ceres—having been discovered in 1801. They were initially only used infrequently as writers preferred the planets as settings. The once-popular Phaëton hypothesis, which states that the asteroid belt consists of the remnants of the former fifth planet that existed in an orbit between Mars and Jupiter before somehow being destroyed, has been a recurring theme with various explanations for the planet's destruction proposed. This hypothetical former planet is in science fiction often called \"Bodia\" in reference to Johann Elert Bode, for whom the since-discredited Titius–Bode law that predicts the planet's existence is named.\nBy the early 1900s, the asteroids started making more regular appearances. The asteroid field has often been depicted as having asteroids so close together as to impede travel, though this became less common later in the century as writers started portraying a more realistic density. Because the asteroids are so small, they are usually not depicted as inhabited—though in some works they are nevertheless habitable. In other works they are made so by human activity, be it terraforming or hollowing out to create habitats on the inside. The latter concept has also been used for turning asteroids into spacecraft. Human activity in the asteroid belt has featured frequently since the pulp era of science fiction, particularly in the form of asteroid mining. Space piracy also debuted as a theme around the same time. In works where the asteroid belt is settled by humans, it is often conceptually similar to the Wild West.\nThe threat of impact events by asteroids has been a recurring theme. It received successive boosts in popularity following the end of World War II (possibly as a result of nuclear anxiety), the 1980 publication of the Alvarez hypothesis about the extinction of the dinosaurs, and the 1994 impact of Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 on Jupiter. Many stories involve attempts to alter asteroid trajectories to avert such collisions, while in some stories they are instead caused intentionally.",

CubeSats are deployed into orbit from the International Space Station, or launched as secondary payloads on a launch vehicle. As of December 2023, more than 2,300 CubeSats have been launched.\nIn 1999, California Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly) professor Jordi Puig-Suari and Bob Twiggs, a professor at Stanford University Space Systems Development Laboratory, developed the CubeSat specifications to promote and develop the skills necessary for the design, manufacture, and testing of small satellites intended for low Earth orbit (LEO) that perform scientific research and explore new space technologies. Academia accounted for the majority of CubeSat launches until 2013, when more than half of launches were for non-academic purposes, and by 2014 most newly deployed CubeSats were for commercial or amateur projects.\n\nFunctions typically involve experiments that can be miniaturized or serve purposes such as Earth observation or amateur radio. CubeSats are employed to demonstrate spacecraft technologies intended for small satellites or that present questionable feasibility and are unlikely to justify the cost of a larger satellite. Scientific experiments with unproven underlying theory may also find themselves aboard CubeSats because their low cost can justify higher risks. Biological research payloads have been flown on several missions, with more planned. Several missions to the Moon and beyond are planning to use CubeSats. The first CubeSats in deep space were flown in the MarCO mission, where two CubeSats were launched towards Mars in May 2018 alongside the successful InSight mission.\nSome CubeSats have become countries' first-ever satellites, launched either by universities, state-owned, or private companies.

Launch operations for the Apollo, Skylab and Space Shuttle programs were carried out from Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39 and managed by KSC. Located on the east coast of Florida, KSC is adjacent to Cape Canaveral Space Force Station (CCSFS). The management of the two entities work very closely together, share resources, and operate facilities on each other's property.\nThough the first Apollo flights and all Project Mercury and Project Gemini flights took off from the then-Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, the launches were managed by KSC and its previous organization, the Launch Operations Directorate. Starting with the fourth Gemini mission, the NASA launch control center in Florida (Mercury Control Center, later the Launch Control Center) began handing off control of the vehicle to the Mission Control Center in Houston, shortly after liftoff; in prior missions it held control throughout the entire mission.\nAdditionally, the center manages launch of robotic and commercial crew missions and researches food production and in-situ resource utilization for off-Earth exploration. Since 2010, the center has worked to become a multi-user spaceport through industry partnerships, even adding a new launch pad (LC-39C) in 2015.\nThere are about 700 facilities and buildings grouped throughout the center's 144,000 acres (580 km2).

      "content": "The magnetosphere of Saturn is the cavity created in the flow of the solar wind by the planet's internally generated magnetic field. Discovered in 1979 by the Pioneer 11 spacecraft, Saturn's magnetosphere is the second largest of any planet in the Solar System after Jupiter. The magnetopause, the boundary between Saturn's magnetosphere and the solar wind, is located at a distance of about 20 Saturn radii from the planet's center, while its magnetotail stretches hundreds of Saturn radii behind it.\nSaturn's magnetosphere is filled with plasmas originating from both the planet and its moons. The main source is the small moon Enceladus, which ejects as much as 1,000 kg/s of water vapor from the geysers on its south pole, a portion of which is ionized and forced to co-rotate with the Saturn's magnetic field. This loads the field with as much as 100 kg of water group ions per second. This plasma gradually moves out from the inner magnetosphere via the interchange instability mechanism and then escapes through the magnetotail.\nThe interaction between Saturn's magnetosphere and the solar wind generates bright oval aurorae around the planet's poles observed in visible, infrared and ultraviolet light. The aurorae are related to the powerful saturnian kilometric radiation (SKR), which spans the frequency interval between 100 kHz to 1300 kHz and was once thought to modulate with a period equal to the planet's rotation. However, later measurements showed that the periodicity of the SKR's modulation varies by as much as 1%, and so probably does not exactly coincide with Saturn's true rotational period, which as of 2010 remains unknown. Inside the magnetosphere there are radiation belts, which house particles with energy as high as tens of megaelectronvolts. The energetic particles have significant influence on the surfaces of inner icy moons of Saturn.\nIn 1980–1981 the magnetosphere of Saturn was studied by the Voyager spacecraft. Up until September 2017 it was a subject of ongoing investigation by Cassini mission, which arrived in 2004 and spent over 13 years observing the planet.",

      "title": "Venus de Milo",
      "content": "The Venus de Milo or Aphrodite of Melos is an ancient Greek marble sculpture that was created during the Hellenistic period.  Its exact dating is uncertain, but the modern consensus places it in the 2nd century BC, perhaps between 160 and 110 BC.  It was discovered in 1820 on the island of Milos, Greece, and has been displayed at the Louvre Museum since 1821. Since the statue's discovery, it has become one of the most famous works of ancient Greek sculpture in the world.\nThe Venus de Milo is believed to depict Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love, whose Roman counterpart was Venus.  Made of Parian marble, the statue is larger than life size, standing over 2 metres (6 ft 7 in) high. The statue is missing both arms. The original position of these missing arms is uncertain. The sculpture was originally identified as depicting Aphrodite holding the apple of discord as a marble hand holding an apple was found alongside it; recent scientific analysis supports the identification of this hand as part of the sculpture. On the basis of a now-lost inscription found near the sculpture, it has been attributed to Alexandros from Antioch on the Maeander, though the name on the inscription is uncertain and its connection to the Venus is disputed.\nThe Venus de Milo rapidly became a cornerstone of the Louvre's antiquities collection in the aftermath of the Napoleonic Wars, and its fame spread through distribution in photographs and three-dimensional copies. The statue inspired over 70 poems, influenced 19th-century art and the Surrealist movement in the early 20th century, and has been featured in various modern artistic projects, including film and advertising. In contrast to the popular appreciation of the sculpture, scholars have been more critical. Though upon its discovery the Venus was considered a classical masterpiece, since it was re-dated to the Hellenistic period classicists have neglected the Venus in favour of studying sculptures mentioned in ancient written sources, even though they only survive as later copies which are technically inferior to the Venus.",

      "content": "Titanium is a chemical element; it has symbol Ti and atomic number 22. Found in nature only as an oxide, it can be reduced to produce a lustrous transition metal with a silver color, low density, and high strength, resistant to corrosion in sea water, aqua regia, and chlorine.\nTitanium was discovered in Cornwall, Great Britain, by William Gregor in 1791 and was named by Martin Heinrich Klaproth after the Titans of Greek mythology. The element occurs within a number of minerals, principally rutile and ilmenite, which are widely distributed in the Earth's crust and lithosphere; it is found in almost all living things, as well as bodies of water, rocks, and soils. The metal is extracted from its principal mineral ores by the Kroll and Hunter processes. The most common compound, titanium dioxide (TiO2), is a popular photocatalyst and is used in the manufacture of white pigments. Other compounds include titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4), a component of smoke screens and catalysts; and titanium trichloride (TiCl3), which is used as a catalyst in the production of polypropylene.\nTitanium can be alloyed with iron, aluminium, vanadium, and molybdenum, among other elements. The resulting titanium alloys are strong, lightweight, and versatile, with applications including aerospace (jet engines, missiles, and spacecraft), military, industrial processes (chemicals and petrochemicals, desalination plants, pulp, and paper), automotive, agriculture (farming), sporting goods, jewelry, and consumer electronics. Titanium is also considered one of the most biocompatible metals, leading to a range of medical applications including prostheses, orthopedic implants, dental implants, and surgical instruments.\nThe two most useful properties of the metal are corrosion resistance and strength-to-density ratio, the highest of any metallic element. In its unalloyed condition, titanium is as strong as some steels, but less dense. There are two allotropic forms and five naturally occurring isotopes of this element, 46Ti through 50Ti, with 48Ti being the most abundant (73.8%).",

      "content": "A space suit (or spacesuit) is an environmental suit used for protection from the harsh environment of outer space, mainly from its vacuum as a highly specialized pressure suit, but also its temperature extremes, as well as radiation and micrometeoroids. Basic space suits are worn as a safety precaution inside spacecrafts in case of loss of cabin pressure. For extravehicular activity (EVA) more complex space suits are worn, featuring a portable life support system.\nPressure suits are in general needed at low pressure environments above the Armstrong limit, at around 19,000 m (62,000 ft) above Earth. Space suits augment pressure suits with complex system of equipment and environmental systems designed to keep the wearer comfortable, and to minimize the effort required to bend the limbs, resisting a soft pressure garment's natural tendency to stiffen against the vacuum. A self-contained oxygen supply and environmental control system is frequently employed to allow complete freedom of movement, independent of the spacecraft.\nThree types of space suits exist for different purposes: IVA (intravehicular activity), EVA (extravehicular activity), and IEVA (intra/extravehicular activity). IVA suits are meant to be worn inside a pressurized spacecraft, and are therefore lighter and more comfortable. IEVA suits are meant for use inside and outside the spacecraft, such as the Gemini G4C suit. They include more protection from the harsh conditions of space, such as protection from micrometeoroids and extreme temperature change. EVA suits, such as the EMU, are used outside spacecraft, for either planetary exploration or spacewalks. They must protect the wearer against all conditions of space, as well as provide mobility and functionality.\nThe first full-pressure suits for use at extreme altitudes were designed by individual inventors as early as the 1930s. The first space suit worn by a human in space was the Soviet SK-1 suit worn by Yuri Gagarin in 1961. Since then space suits have been worn beside in Earth orbit, en-route and on the surface of the Moon.",

      "content": "The Saturn Corporation, also known as Saturn LLC, was an American automobile manufacturer, a registered trademark established on January 7, 1985, as a subsidiary of General Motors. The company was an attempt by GM to compete directly with Japanese imports and transplants, initially in the American compact car market. The company was known for its 'no-haggle' sales technique.\nSaturn marketed itself as a \"different kind of car company\" and operated quasi-independently from its parent company,—comprehensively introducing a new car, dealer network, pricing structure, workforce and independently managed manufacturing plant in Spring Hill, Tennessee. The first cars themselves launched five years after the company's inception, and they advanced GM's spaceframe construction—manifesting Saturn's market proposition with their dent-resistant polymer exterior panels.\nOver time, as Saturn drained resources from GM's extensive brand network, the brand would be gradually re-integrated into the GM corporate hierarchy, losing its semi-independent nature and beginning to work on models that increasingly compromised the independence of the brand, first with mild use of shared GM products and platforms in their lineup, but later with a myriad of \"parts-bin\" cars built mostly or entirely from pre-existing GM equipment rather than independently-engineered material. As GM struggled in the onset of the 2008 economic recession, the parent company further curtailed Saturn's development budgets, leaving Saturn to almost fully badge engineer products from other divisions, notably a series of federalized models from Opel.  With the gradual shift in internal practices and external outcomes, Saturn lost its unique selling proposition, and the market lost interest.  Annual sales achieved their highest level in 1994, with 286,003 vehicles marketed.\nFollowing a failed attempt by Penske Automotive to acquire Saturn from GM in September 2009, Saturn ended production in October 2009, ended outstanding franchises in October 2010, and ceased operations 25 years after it began.",

It was launched into an elliptical low Earth orbit by the Soviet Union on 4 October 1957 as part of the Soviet space program. It sent a radio signal back to Earth for three weeks before its three silver-zinc batteries became depleted. Aerodynamic drag caused it to fall back into the atmosphere on 4 January 1958.\nIt was a polished metal sphere 58 cm (23 in) in diameter with four external radio antennas to broadcast radio pulses. Its radio signal was easily detectable by amateur radio operators, and the 65° orbital inclination made its flight path cover virtually the entire inhabited Earth.\nThe satellite's success was unanticipated by the United States. This precipitated the American Sputnik crisis and triggered the Space Race. The launch was the beginning of a new era of political, military, technological, and scientific developments. The word sputnik is Russian for satellite when interpreted in an astronomical context; its other meanings are spouse or travelling companion.\nTracking and studying Sputnik 1 from Earth provided scientists with valuable information. The density of the upper atmosphere could be deduced from its drag on the orbit, and the propagation of its radio signals gave data about the ionosphere.\nSputnik 1 was launched during the International Geophysical Year from Site No.1/5, at the 5th Tyuratam range, in Kazakh SSR (now known as the Baikonur Cosmodrome). The satellite travelled at a peak speed of about 8 km/s (18,000 mph), taking 96.20 minutes to complete each orbit. It transmitted on 20.005 and 40.002 MHz, which were monitored by radio operators throughout the world. The signals continued for 22 days until the transmitter batteries depleted on 26 October 1957. On 4 January 1958, after three months in orbit, Sputnik 1 burned up while reentering Earth's atmosphere, having completed 1,440 orbits of the Earth, and travelling a distance of approximately 70,000,000 km (43,000,000 mi).",

The Sturnidae are named for the genus Sturnus, which in turn comes from the Latin word for starling, sturnus. The family contains 128 species which are divided into 36 genera. Many Asian species, particularly the larger ones, are called mynas, and many African species are known as glossy starlings because of their iridescent plumage. Starlings are native to Europe, Asia, and Africa, as well as northern Australia and the islands of the tropical Pacific. Several European and Asian species have been introduced to these areas, as well as North America, Hawaii, and New Zealand, where they generally compete for habitats with native birds and are considered to be invasive species. The starling species familiar to most people in Europe and North America is the common starling, and throughout much of Asia and the Pacific.\nHaving strong feet, their flight is strong and direct, and they are very gregarious. Their preferred habitat is fairly open country, they eat insects and fruit, and most species nest in holes and lay blue or white eggs. Several species live around human habitation and are effectively omnivores. Many species search for prey such as grubs by \"open-bill probing\", that is, forcefully opening the bill after inserting it into a crevice, thus expanding the hole and exposing the prey; this behaviour is referred to by the German verb zirkeln (pronounced [ˈtsɪʁkl̩n]).\nStarlings have diverse and complex vocalizations and have been known to embed sounds from their surroundings into their own calls, including car alarms and human speech patterns. The birds can recognize particular individuals by their calls and are the subject of research into the evolution of human language.",

With these goals in mind Space Station Freedom represents substantial opportunities and significant challenges to the Life Sciences Division. For the first time it will be possible to replicate experimental data from a variety of simultaneously exposed species with appropriate controls and real-time analytical capabilities over extended periods of time. At the same time, a system for monitoring and ameliorating the physiological adaptations that occur in humans subjected to extended space flight must be evolved to provide the continuing operational support to the SSF crew. To meet its goals, and take advantage of the opportunities and overcome the challenges presented by Space Station Freedom, the Life Sciences Division is developing a suite of discipline-focused sequence. The research phase of the Life Sciences Space Station Freedom Program will commence with the utilization flights following the deployment of the U.S. laboratory module and achievement of Man Tended Capability. Investigators that want the Life Sciences Division to sponsor their experiment on SSF can do so in one of three ways: submitting a proposal in response to a NASA Research Announcement (NRA), submitting a proposal in response to an Announcement of Opportunity (AO), or submitting an unsolicited proposal. The scientific merit of all proposals will be evaluated by peer review panels. Proposals will also be evaluated based on relevance to NASA's missions and on the results of an Engineering and Cost Analyses. The Life Sciences Division expects that the majority of its funding opportunities will be announced through NRA's. It is anticipated that the first NRA will be released approximately three years before first element launch (currently scheduled for late 1995). Subsequent NRA's will be released on a rotating two year cycle.",

Newspapers can cover a wide variety of fields such as politics, business, sports, art, and science. They often include materials such as opinion columns, weather forecasts, reviews of local services, obituaries, birth notices, crosswords, sudoku puzzles, editorial cartoons, comic strips, and advice columns.\nMost newspapers are businesses, and they pay their expenses with a mixture of subscription revenue, newsstand sales, and advertising revenue. The journalism organizations that publish newspapers are themselves often metonymically called newspapers. Newspapers have traditionally been published in print (usually on cheap, low-grade paper called newsprint). However, today most newspapers are also published on websites as online newspapers, and some have even abandoned their print versions entirely.\nNewspapers developed in the 17th century as information sheets for merchants. By the early 19th century, many cities in Europe, as well as North and South America, published newspapers. Some newspapers with high editorial independence, high journalism quality, and large circulation are viewed as newspapers of record. With the popularity of the Internet, many newspapers are now digital, with their news presented online as the main medium that most of the readers use, with the print edition being secondary (for the minority of customers that choose to pay for it) or, in some cases, retired. The decline of newspapers in the early 21st century was at first largely interpreted as a mere print-versus-digital contest in which digital beats print. The reality is different and multivariate, as newspapers now routinely have online presence; anyone willing to subscribe can read them digitally online. Factors such as classified ads no longer being a large revenue center (because of other ways to buy and sell online) and ad impressions now being dispersed across many media are inputs.",

Informatics is the science and technology of applying computers and computational methods to the systematic analysis, management, interchange, and representation of science data, information, and knowledge. Informatics also includes the use of computers and computational methods to support decision making and applications. Earth Science Informatics (ESI, a.k.a. geoinformatics) is the application of informatics in the Earth science domain. ESI is a rapidly developing discipline integrating computer science, information science, and Earth science. Major national and international research and infrastructure projects in ESI have been carried out or are on-going. Notable among these are: the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS), the European Commissions INSPIRE, the U.S. NSDI and Geospatial One-Stop, the NASA EOSDIS, and the NSF DataONE, EarthCube and Cyberinfrastructure for Geoinformatics. More than 18 departments and agencies in the U.S. federal government have been active in Earth science informatics. All major space agencies in the world, have been involved in ESI research and application activities. In the United States, the Federation of Earth Science Information Partners (ESIP), whose membership includes over 180 organizations (government, academic and commercial) dedicated to managing, delivering and applying Earth science data, has been working on many ESI topics since 1998. The Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS)s Working Group on Information Systems and Services (WGISS) has been actively coordinating the ESI activities among the space agencies.The talk will present an overview of current efforts in ESI, the role members of IEEE GRSS play, and discuss recent developments in data preservation and provenance.",

There are four globally operational GNSS systems: the United States Global Positioning System (GPS), Russia's Global Navigation Satellite System (GLONASS), China's BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS), and the European Union's Galileo.\nA satellite-based augmentation system (SBAS) is a system that designed to enhance the accuracy of the global GNSS systems. The SBAS systems include Japan's Quasi-Zenith Satellite System (QZSS), India's GAGAN, and the European EGNOS, all of them based on GPS. Previous iterations of the BeiDou navigation system and the present Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System (IRNSS), operationally known as NavIC, are examples of stand-alone operating regional navigation satellite systems (RNSS). \nSatellite navigation devices determine their location (longitude, latitude, and altitude/elevation) to high precision (within a few centimeters to meters) using time signals transmitted along a line of sight by radio from satellites. The system can be used for providing position, navigation or for tracking the position of something fitted with a receiver (satellite tracking). The signals also allow the electronic receiver to calculate the current local time to a high precision, which allows time synchronisation. These uses are collectively known as Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT). Satnav systems operate independently of any telephonic or internet reception, though these technologies can enhance the usefulness of the positioning information generated.\nGlobal coverage for each system is generally achieved by a satellite constellation of 18–30 medium Earth orbit (MEO) satellites spread between several orbital planes. The actual systems vary, but all use orbital inclinations of >50° and orbital periods of roughly twelve hours (at an altitude of about 20,000 kilometres or 12,000 miles).",

The missions were planned, as part of the Apollo Applications Program, between 1966 and 1968 and were scheduled for launch in 1974–75. The probes were conceived as precursors for a crewed Mars landing in the 1980s.\nOriginally, NASA had proposed a direct lander using a variant of the Apollo Command Module launched atop of a Saturn IB rocket with a Centaur upper stage.  With the discovery by Mariner 4 in 1965 that Mars had only a tenuous atmosphere, the mission was changed to have both an orbiter and lander.  This required the use of a Saturn V to launch two probes at once. The orbiter would have been a modified Mariner probe identical to that employed for Mariner 8 and Mariner 9, while the landers would have been Surveyor moon probes modified with the use of aeroshells and a combination parachute/retrorocket landing systems.\nFunding for the program, like that of the entire AAP, was cut in 1968 and the mission itself was cancelled entirely in 1971, mainly on the grounds that launching both probes on a single rocket was both risky and expensive. Voyager was the first major space science project to be cancelled by the U.S. Congress.\nDespite the cancellation, the planning and development of the Voyager Mars program was eventually carried out by NASA's Viking program in the mid-1970s. Cheaper and simpler than the Voyager Mars program (using the same Mariner 8/9 design for the orbiter, but with an automobile-sized lander with a very expensive microbiology lab), the Viking 1 and Viking 2 probes were launched to Mars on separate Titan IIIE/Centaur rockets in 1975 and reached Mars in 1976.\nAfter the cancellation, the \"Voyager\" name was recycled for the Mariner 11 and Mariner 12 probes to the outer planets, with the latter probe, Voyager 2 (Mariner 12), completing another ambitious post-Apollo project, the \"Grand Tour\". The Saturn V had also been planned at one point as the launch vehicle for an upscaled probe for this mission.",

      "content": "The National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA) Astrophysics Division (APD) funds and manages missions and studies that seek to broaden our understanding of our place in the universe. These science missions are enabled by technologies developed through APD’s technology development programs. APD has funded approximately seven different technology development programs over the last ten years which support basic research and target varying Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs). The funding has targeted technology for future space flight experiments as well as suborbital science investigations. To understand the overall impact of APD’s investment on astrophysics technology advancement through their grants and contracts, APD engaged The Aerospace Corporation to conduct an independent, comprehensive Astrophysics Technology Heritage Study. The study was conducted in the 2021-2022 timeframe, first focusing priority on infusion of competed grants and general trends, followed by directed grants and further trend analysis and technology characterization. The study included three major components: a grants database, a missions database, and a survey of \tPrincipal Investigators (PIs). The study found that APD grants and contracts fund a healthy portfolio of technologies that resulted in an overall 62% infusion rate, as suborbital missions provide ample science and technology maturation and platform transition opportunities. Within the 62% of infused grants, 12% were infused into space missions and another 31% were suborbital. The study also looked at various other characteristics of the grant awards including the organizations they were awarded to and award trends by PI. Technology focus areas and detector types were also investigated, as well as technology platform transitions from on mission environment (e.g., suborbital to space). Additional feedback from PIs was also requested and evaluated including alternative benefits of grants and reasons development did, or did not, succeed.",

      "content": "Solar sails (also known as lightsails, light sails, and photon sails) are a method of spacecraft propulsion using radiation pressure exerted by sunlight on large surfaces. A number of spaceflight missions to test solar propulsion and navigation have been proposed since the 1980s. The two spacecraft to successfully use the technology for propulsion were IKAROS, launched in 2010, and LightSail-2, launched in 2019.\nA useful analogy to solar sailing may be a sailing boat; the light exerting a force on the large surface is akin to a sail being blown by the wind. High-energy laser beams could be used as an alternative light source to exert much greater force than would be possible using sunlight, a concept known as beam sailing. Solar sail craft offer the possibility of low-cost operations combined with high speeds (relative to chemical rockets) and long operating lifetimes. Since they have few moving parts and use no propellant, they can potentially be used numerous times for the delivery of payloads.\nSolar sails use a phenomenon that has a proven, measured effect on astrodynamics. Solar pressure affects all spacecraft, whether in interplanetary space or in orbit around a planet or small body. A typical spacecraft going to Mars, for example, will be displaced thousands of kilometers by solar pressure, so the effects must be accounted for in trajectory planning, which has been done since the time of the earliest interplanetary spacecraft of the 1960s. Solar pressure also affects the orientation of a spacecraft, a factor that must be included in spacecraft design.\nThe total force exerted on an 800 by 800 metres (2,600 by 2,600 ft) solar sail, for example, is about 5 N (1.1 lbf) at Earth's distance from the Sun, making it a low-thrust propulsion system, similar to spacecraft propelled by electric engines, but as it uses no propellant, that force is exerted almost constantly and the collective effect over time is great enough to be considered a potential manner of propelling spacecraft.",

Consisting of a gold half eagle ($5 coin), two different sizes of silver dollars, and a copper-nickel clad half dollar, each of the four was issued in proof condition, with all but the larger silver dollar also issued in uncirculated. The gold coins were struck at the West Point Mint, the silver at the Philadelphia Mint and the base metal half dollars at the mints in Denver and San Francisco.\nAll four coins have the same design. The obverse depicts a bootprint on the lunar surface, based on a photograph taken by Aldrin. That design is by Maine sculptor Gary Cooper, with engraving by Joseph Menna of the Mint. The reverse, as mandated by Congress, depicts the visor and surrounding helmet of Aldrin's space suit, with Armstrong, the U.S. Flag and the Apollo Lunar Module Eagle in the reflection. This is based on a well-known photograph taken by Armstrong, and was created and engraved by Phebe Hemphill of the Mint. The depiction of Aldrin made him the seventh individual to appear on a U.S. coin who was alive at the time the coins were struck.\nThe Apollo 11 coins are curved, so that the obverse is concave and the reverse is convex. Prior to the release date of January 24, 2019, there was anticipation that some denominations might sell out, as had occurred with the previous U.S. issue of curved pieces, the 2014 National Baseball Hall of Fame coins. This did not prove to be the case, and none of the coins sold out before sales ended on December 27, 2019. It was nevertheless the most successful U.S. commemorative coin program since the Baseball Hall of Fame issue, with over 600,000 Apollo 11 coins sold. The larger silver dollar won the Coin of the Year Award for 2019-dated issues, and was voted Best Collectible Silver Coin at the 2023 Mint Directors Conference.",

      "content": "Asteroid City is a 2023 American science fiction comedy drama film written, directed, and produced by Wes Anderson, from a story he wrote with Roman Coppola. It features an ensemble cast, including Jason Schwartzman, Scarlett Johansson, Tom Hanks, Jeffrey Wright, Tilda Swinton, Bryan Cranston, Edward Norton, Adrien Brody, Liev Schreiber, Hope Davis, Steve Park, Rupert Friend, Maya Hawke, Steve Carell, Matt Dillon, Hong Chau, Willem Dafoe, Margot Robbie, Tony Revolori, Jake Ryan, and Jeff Goldblum. Its plot mostly follows a play about a Junior Stargazer convention in a retrofuturistic version of 1955, but it becomes metatextual because the making of the play is the subject of a television documentary. The story is about extraterrestrials and UFOs witnessed in the American Southwestern desert in close proximity to atomic test sites after World War II.\nThe project was announced in September 2020 as an untitled romance film, with Anderson writing, producing and directing, alongside Jeremy Dawson of American Empirical Pictures and Steven Rales of Indian Paintbrush. In February 2021, it was described as being about a \"group of brainy teenagers\". Originally set for Rome, filming took place in Chinchón, Spain, between August and October, 2021, with cinematographer Robert D. Yeoman. Several sets resembling a desert landscape and a mock train station were used. Post-production included editor Barney Pilling and a musical score composed by frequent Anderson composer Alexandre Desplat, featuring country and western songs from many artists. The official title for Asteroid City was revealed in October 2021 at the BFI London Film Festival.\nAsteroid City premiered at the 76th Cannes Film Festival on May 23, 2023, where it competed for the Palme d'Or. It began a limited theatrical release through Focus Features in the United States on June 16, 2023, expanding to a wide release a week later. It grossed $54 million worldwide on a $25 million budget, and received generally positive reviews.",

      "content": "Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is deposited on Si <100> wafer ($\\approx$20\ncm2) via Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition (PECVD) using a ns-pulsed\nN2/Ar Micro Hollow Cathode Discharge (MHCD) as a microplasma source. For the\nfirst time, aluminum nitride (AIN) is employed as the dielectric material in\nthe MHCD to mitigate film contamination by atomic oxygen, an issue previously\nobserved with conventional Al 2O3 dielectrics. A comprehensive multi-diagnostic\napproach is followed to characterize the deposited h-BN, including Raman\nspectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy\n(AFM), and X-ray photoelectron microscopy (XPS). In parallel, in-situ\ndiagnostics such as optical emission spectroscopy (OES) and intensified CCD\n(ICCD) imaging are used to monitor plasma properties, including emission\nprofiles, gas temperature and discharge morphology. Raman spectra reveal the\nE2g phonon mode of h-BN around 1366 cm_____, confirming successful synthesis.\nSEM imaging reveals an almost complete surface coverage by the film, with\nlocalized delamination. This is probably due to an uneven resistive heating of\nthe Si wafer, rapid post-deposition cooling ($\\sim$13 K/min) and ambient\nexposure. AFM analysis indicates an average thickness of about 33 nm after 90\nminutes of deposition ($\\sim$22 nm/h deposition rate). XPS measurements reveal\nan average B/N atomic ratio of $\\sim$1.5 along the wafer diameter. Deviations\nfrom ideal film properties (e.g., stoichiometric unity, uniform morphology) are\nattributed to plasma-induced inhomogeneities (such as non-uniform species flux\nand temperature gradients) among other factors (e.g., ambient exposure\npost-deposition), which affect nitrogen and boron incorporation and localized\nfilm properties. Despite these challenges, the MHCD-driven PECVD process\ndemonstrates strong potential for scalable h-BN synthesis, with further\noptimization of the reactor design, plasma conditions, and gas chemistry\nrequired to grow ideal films.",

      "content": "The spacecraft bus is a carbon fibre box that houses systems of the telescope and so is the primary support element of the James Webb Space Telescope, launched on 25 December 2021. It hosts a multitude of computing, communication, propulsion, and structural components. The other three elements of the JWST are the Optical Telescope Element (OTE), the Integrated Science Instrument Module (ISIM), and the sunshield. Region 3 of ISIM is also inside the spacecraft bus. Region 3 includes the ISIM Command and Data Handling subsystem and the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) cryocooler.\nThe spacecraft bus must structurally support the 6.5 ton space telescope, while weighing only 350 kg (770 lb). It is made primarily of graphite composite material. It was assembled by Northrop Grumman in Redondo Beach, California by 2015, and then it had to be integrated with the rest of the space telescope leading up to its planned 2018 launch. The bus can provide pointing precision of one arcsecond (1⁄3600°) and isolates vibration down to two milliarcseconds. The fine pointing is done by the JWST fine guidance mirror, obviating the need to physically move the whole mirror or bus.\nThe spacecraft bus is on the Sun-facing \"warm\" side and operates at a temperature of about 300 kelvins (80 °F, 27 °C). Everything on the Sun-facing side must be able to handle the thermal conditions of JWST's halo orbit, which has one side of continuous sunlight and the other shaded by the spacecraft sunshield.\nAnother important aspect of the spacecraft bus is the central computing, memory storage, and communications equipment. The processor and software direct data to and from the instruments, to the solid-state memory core, and to the radio system which can send data back to Earth and receive commands. The computer also controls the pointing and movement of the spacecraft, taking in sensor data from the gyroscopes and star tracker, and sending the necessary commands to the reaction wheels or thrusters.",

It lies at an elevation of approximately 500 metres (1,640 feet) above sea level, on the western shore of Lake Pamvotis (Παμβώτις). Ioannina is located 410 km (255 mi) northwest of Athens, 260 kilometres (162 miles) southwest of Thessaloniki and 80 km (50 miles) east of the port of Igoumenitsa on the Ionian Sea.\nThe city's foundation has traditionally been ascribed to the Byzantine Emperor Justinian in the 6th century AD, but modern archaeological research has uncovered evidence of Hellenistic settlements. Ioannina flourished in the late Byzantine period (13th–15th centuries). It became part of the Despotate of Epirus following the Fourth Crusade and many wealthy Byzantine families fled there following the 1204 sack of Constantinople, with the city experiencing great prosperity and considerable autonomy, despite the political turmoil. Ioannina surrendered to the Ottomans in 1430 and until 1868 it was the administrative center of the Pashalik of Yanina. In the period between the 18th and 19th centuries, the city was a major center of the modern Greek Enlightenment. Ioannina was ceded to Greece in 1913 following the Balkan Wars.\nThe city is also characterized by various green areas and parks, including Molos (Lake Front), Litharitsia Park, Pirsinella Park (Giannotiko Saloni), Suburban Forest. There are two hospitals, the General Hospital of Ioannina \"G. Hatzikosta\", and the University Hospital of Ioannina. It is also the seat of the University of Ioannina. The city's emblem consists of the portrait of the Byzantine Emperor Justinian crowned by a stylized depiction of the nearby ancient theater of Dodona.",

Rovers have several advantages over stationary landers: they examine more territory, they can be directed to interesting features, they can place themselves in sunny positions to weather winter months, and they can advance the knowledge of how to perform very remote robotic vehicle control. They serve a different purpose than orbital spacecraft like Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. A more recent development is the Mars helicopter.\nAs of May 2021, there have been six successful robotically operated Mars rovers; the first five, managed by the American NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, were (by date of Mars landing): Sojourner (1997), Spirit (2004–2010), Opportunity (2004–2018), Curiosity (2012–present), and Perseverance (2021–present). The sixth, managed by the China National Space Administration, is Zhurong (2021–2022).\nOn January 24, 2016, NASA reported that then current studies on Mars by Opportunity  and Curiosity would be searching for evidence of ancient life, including a biosphere based on autotrophic, chemotrophic or chemolithoautotrophic microorganisms, as well as ancient water, including fluvio-lacustrine environments (plains related to ancient rivers or lakes) that may have been habitable. The search for evidence of habitability, taphonomy (related to fossils), and organic carbon on Mars is now a primary NASA objective.\nThe Soviet probes, Mars 2 and Mars 3, were physically tethered probes; Sojourner was dependent on the Mars Pathfinder base station for communication with Earth; Opportunity, Spirit and Curiosity were on their own. As of 27 April 2025, Curiosity is still active, while Spirit, Opportunity, and Sojourner completed their missions before losing contact. On February 18, 2021, Perseverance, the newest American Mars rover, successfully landed.  On May 14, 2021, China's Zhurong became the first non-American rover to successfully operate on Mars.",

      "content": "Mathematics during the Golden Age of Islam, especially during the 9th and 10th centuries, was built upon syntheses of Greek mathematics (Euclid, Archimedes, Apollonius) and Indian mathematics (Aryabhata, Brahmagupta). Important developments of the period include extension of the place-value system to include decimal fractions, the systematised study of algebra and advances in geometry and trigonometry.\nThe medieval Islamic world underwent significant developments in mathematics. Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwārizmī played a key role in this transformation, introducing algebra as a distinct field in the 9th century. Al-Khwārizmī's approach, departing from earlier arithmetical traditions, laid the groundwork for the arithmetization of algebra, influencing mathematical thought for an extended period. Successors like Al-Karaji expanded on his work, contributing to advancements in various mathematical domains. The practicality and broad applicability of these mathematical methods facilitated the dissemination of Arabic mathematics to the West, contributing substantially to the evolution of Western mathematics.\nArabic mathematical knowledge spread through various channels during the medieval era, driven by the practical applications of Al-Khwārizmī's methods. This dissemination was influenced not only by economic and political factors but also by cultural exchanges, exemplified by events such as the Crusades and the translation movement. The Islamic Golden Age, spanning from the 8th to the 14th century, marked a period of considerable advancements in various scientific disciplines, attracting scholars from medieval Europe seeking access to this knowledge. Trade routes and cultural interactions played a crucial role in introducing Arabic mathematical ideas to the West. The translation of Arabic mathematical texts, along with Greek and Roman works, during the 14th to 17th century, played a pivotal role in shaping the intellectual landscape of the Renaissance.",

As the largest space station ever constructed, it primarily serves as a platform for conducting scientific experiments in microgravity and studying the space environment.\nThe station is divided into two main sections: the Russian Orbital Segment (ROS), developed by Roscosmos, and the US Orbital Segment (USOS), built by NASA, ESA, JAXA, and CSA. A striking feature of the ISS is the Integrated Truss Structure, which connect the station’s vast system of solar panels and radiators to its pressurized modules. These modules support diverse functions, including scientific research, crew habitation, storage, spacecraft control, and airlock operations. The ISS has eight docking and berthing ports for visiting spacecraft. The station orbits the Earth at an average altitude of 400 kilometres (250 miles) and circles the Earth in roughly 93 minutes, completing 15.5 orbits per day.\nThe ISS programme combines two previously planned crewed Earth-orbiting stations: the United States' Space Station Freedom and the Soviet Union's Mir-2. The first ISS module was launched in 1998, with major components delivered by Proton and Soyuz rockets and the Space Shuttle. Long-term occupancy began on 2 November 2000, with the arrival of the Expedition 1 crew. Since then, the ISS has remained continuously inhabited for 24 years and 268 days, the longest continuous human presence in space. By March 2024, 279 individuals from 22 countries had visited the station.\nFuture plans for the ISS include the addition of at least one module, Axiom Space's Payload Power Thermal Module. The station is expected to remain operational until the end of 2030, after which it will be de-orbited using a dedicated NASA spacecraft.",

A common portrayal at the time was of black holes as hazards to spacefarers, a motif that has also recurred in later works. \nThe concept of black holes became popular in science and fiction alike in the 1960s. Authors quickly seized upon the relativistic effect of gravitational time dilation, whereby time passes more slowly closer to a black hole due to its immense gravitational field. Black holes also became a popular means of space travel in science fiction, especially when the notion of wormholes emerged as a relatively plausible way to achieve faster-than-light travel. In this concept, a black hole is connected to its theoretical opposite, a so-called white hole, and as such acts as a gateway to another point in space which might be very distant from the point of entry. More exotically, the point of emergence is occasionally portrayed as another point in time—thus enabling time travel—or even an entirely different universe.\nMore fanciful depictions of black holes that do not correspond to their known or predicted properties also appear. As nothing inside the event horizon—the distance away from the black hole where the escape velocity exceeds the speed of light—can be observed from the outside, authors have been free to employ artistic license when depicting the interiors of black holes. A small number of works also portray black holes as being sentient.\nBesides stellar-mass black holes, supermassive and especially micro black holes also make occasional appearances. Supermassive black holes are a common feature of modern space opera. Recurring themes in stories depicting micro black holes include spaceship propulsion, threatening or causing the destruction of the Earth, and serving as a source of gravity in outer-space settlements.",

Discovery was the first of the three active Space Shuttles to be retired, completing its final mission on March 9, 2011; Endeavour did so on June 1. The final shuttle mission was completed with the landing of Atlantis on July 21, 2011, closing the 30-year Space Shuttle program.\nThe Shuttle was presented to the public in 1972 as a \"space truck\" which would, among other things, be used to build a United States space station in low Earth orbit in the early 1990s and then be replaced by a new vehicle. When the concept of the U.S. space station evolved into that of the International Space Station, which suffered from long delays and design changes before it could be completed, the service life of the Space Shuttle fleet was extended several times until 2011 when it was finally retired.\nAfter the Columbia loss in 2003, the Columbia Accident Investigation Board report showed that the Space Transportation System (STS) was risky and unsafe. In 2004, President George W. Bush announced (along with the VSE policy) that the Shuttles would be retired in 2010 (after completing the ISS assembly).\nIn/by 2010 the Shuttle was formally scheduled for retirement with Atlantis being taken out of service first after STS-132 in May of that year, but the program was once again extended when the two final planned missions were delayed until 2011. Later, one additional mission was added for Atlantis for July 2011, extending the program further. Counter-proposals to the shuttle's retirement were considered by Congress and the prime contractor United Space Alliance as late as Spring 2010.\nHardware developed for the Space Shuttle met various ends with conclusion of the program, including donation, disuse and/or disposal, or reuse. An example of reuse is that one of the three Multi-Purpose Logistics Module (MPLM) was converted to a permanent module for the International Space Station.",

Most of the mass in a typical galaxy is in the form of dark matter, with only a few per cent of that mass visible in the form of stars and nebulae. Supermassive black holes are a common feature at the centres of galaxies.\nGalaxies are categorised according to their visual morphology as elliptical, spiral, or irregular. The Milky Way is an example of a spiral galaxy. It is estimated that there are between 200 billion (2×1011) to 2 trillion galaxies in the observable universe. Most galaxies are 1,000 to 100,000 parsecs in diameter (approximately 3,000 to 300,000 light years) and are separated by distances in the order of millions of parsecs (or megaparsecs). For comparison, the Milky Way has a diameter of at least 26,800 parsecs (87,400 ly) and is separated from the Andromeda Galaxy, its nearest large neighbour, by just over 750,000 parsecs (2.5 million ly).\nThe space between galaxies is filled with a tenuous gas (the intergalactic medium) with an average density of less than one atom per cubic metre. Most galaxies are gravitationally organised into groups, clusters and superclusters. The Milky Way is part of the Local Group, which it dominates along with the Andromeda Galaxy. The group is part of the Virgo Supercluster. At the largest scale, these associations are generally arranged into sheets and filaments surrounded by immense voids. Both the Local Group and the Virgo Supercluster are contained in a much larger cosmic structure named Laniakea.",

      "content": "The Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport (InSight) mission was a robotic lander designed to study the deep interior of the planet Mars. It was manufactured by Lockheed Martin Space, was managed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), and two of its three scientific instruments were built by European agencies. InSight confirmed \"marsquakes\" on the planet and thus a still active interior.\nThe mission launched on 5 May 2018 at 11:05:01 UTC aboard an Atlas V-401 launch vehicle and successfully landed at Elysium Planitia on Mars on 26 November 2018 at 19:52:59 UTC. InSight was active on Mars for 1440 sols (1480 days; 4 years, 19 days).\nInSight's objectives were to place a seismometer, called Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure (SEIS), on the surface of Mars to measure seismic activity and provide accurate 3D models of the planet's interior; and measure internal heat transfer using a heat probe called HP3 to study Mars's early geological evolution. This was intended to provide a new understanding of how the Solar System's terrestrial planets – Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars – and Earth's Moon formed and evolved.\nThe lander was originally planned for launch in March 2016. An instrument problem delayed the launch beyond the 2016 launch window. NASA officials rescheduled the InSight launch to May 2018 and during the wait the instrument was repaired. This increased the total cost from US$675 million to US$830 million.\nInSight successfully landed on Mars on 26 November 2018. Due to excessive dust on its solar panels preventing it from recharging, NASA put InSight in low-power mode for detecting seismic events in July 2022 and continued monitoring the lander through the operational period ending in December 2022. On 20 December 2022, NASA announced that the InSight lander had lost communications with Earth on 15 December 2022, with the end of the mission being declared on 21 December 2022.",

Her character was created by Takashi Yuda, Tetsuya Mizuguchi and Jake Kazdel in the late 1990s and debuted in December 1999 with the release of Space Channel 5.\nWithin the fictional universe of Space Channel 5, Ulala is a reporter for the titular news channel and recurring savior of the galaxy who defeats alien forces with dance moves, alongside rival reporters Pudding and Jaguar. She is assisted by her boss Fuse during live broadcasts and is credited as the most well-known reporter in the Milky Way by her fans and crew members. Ten years prior to the Morolian Invasion of 2499, Ulala was the sole survivor of a deadly spaceship accident that resulted in the death of everyone aboard, including her parents. She was rescued by former Channel 5 reporter Jaguar and later influenced her to become a journalist. Ten years later, Ulala is the star of Ulala's Swingin' Report Show and is determined to solve the mystery of the abrupt alien invasion while taking part in dance battles against rival reporters.\nUlala's reception remains generally positive among video game journalists and critics, receiving praise for her characterization, personality, design, voice, and heroism. Due to her popularity during the 2000s, Ulala was featured in several other Sega-published video games, as well as promotional material in other media, which included television appearances, several lines of collectible merchandise of the character, and video game cameos. She also served as a mascot for the Sega Dreamcast before its discontinuation. In more recent years, Ulala is often regarded as one of Sega's greatest characters, and a video game icon, by both the fanbase and critics alike. In the year 2000, Ulala was nominated for the \"Original Game Character of the Year\" by the International Game Developers Association.",

It lies in the constellation Aquarius approximately 40.66 light-years away from Earth, and it has a surface temperature of about 2,566 K (2,290 °C; 4,160 °F). Its radius is slightly larger than Jupiter's and it has a mass of about 9% of the Sun. It is estimated to be 7.6 billion years old, making it older than the Solar System. The discovery of the star was first published in 2000.\nObservations in 2016 from TRAPPIST–South (Transiting Planets and Planetesimals Small Telescope project) at La Silla Observatory in Chile and other telescopes led to the discovery of two terrestrial planets in orbit around TRAPPIST-1. In 2017, further analysis of the original observations identified five more terrestrial planets. The seven planets take between 1.5 and 19 days to orbit the star in circular orbits. They are all likely tidally locked to TRAPPIST-1, and it is believed that each planet is in permanent day on one side and permanent night on the other. Their masses are comparable to that of Earth and they all lie in the same plane; seen from Earth, they pass in front of the star. This placement allowed the planets to be detected: when they pass in front of the star, its apparent magnitude dims.\nUp to four of the planets—designated d, e, f, and g—orbit at distances where temperatures are likely suitable for the existence of liquid water, and are thus potentially hospitable to life. There is no evidence of an atmosphere on any of the planets, and observations of TRAPPIST-1b have in particular ruled out the existence of an atmosphere. It is unclear whether radiation emissions from TRAPPIST-1 would allow for such atmospheres. The planets have low densities; they may consist of large amounts of volatile material. Due to the possibility of several of the planets being habitable, the system has drawn interest from researchers and has appeared in popular culture.",

Iovis [ˈjɔwɪs]), was the god of the sky and thunder, and king of the gods. Jupiter was the chief deity of Roman state religion throughout the Republican and Imperial eras, until Christianity became the dominant religion of the Empire. In Roman mythology, he negotiates with Numa Pompilius, the second king of Rome, to establish principles of Roman religion such as offering, or sacrifice.\nJupiter is thought to have originated as a sky god. His identifying implement is the thunderbolt and his primary sacred animal is the eagle, which held precedence over other birds in the taking of auspices and became one of the most common symbols of the Roman army (see Aquila). The two emblems were often combined to represent the god in the form of an eagle holding in its claws a thunderbolt, frequently seen on Greek and Roman coins. As the skygod, he was a divine witness to oaths, the sacred trust on which justice and good government depend. Many of his functions were focused on the Capitoline Hill, where the citadel was located. In the Capitoline Triad, he was the central guardian of the state with Juno and Minerva. His sacred tree was the oak.\nThe Romans regarded Jupiter as the equivalent of the Greek Zeus, and in Latin literature and Roman art, the myths and iconography of Zeus are adapted under the name Jupiter. In the Greek-influenced tradition, Jupiter was the brother of Neptune and Pluto, the Roman equivalents of Poseidon and Hades respectively. Each presided over one of the three realms of the universe: sky, the waters, and the underworld. The Italic Diespiter was also a sky god who manifested himself in the daylight, usually identified with Jupiter. Tinia is usually regarded as his Etruscan counterpart.",

Carl Sagan, an astronomer, proposed the planetary engineering of Venus in 1961, which is considered one of the first accounts of the concept. The term was coined by Jack Williamson in a science-fiction short story (\"Collision Orbit\") published in 1942 in Astounding Science Fiction.\nEven if the environment of a planet could be altered deliberately, the feasibility of creating an unconstrained planetary environment that mimics Earth on another planet has yet to be verified. While Venus and the Moon have been studied in relation to the subject, Mars is usually considered to be the most likely candidate for terraforming. Much study has been done concerning the possibility of heating the planet and altering its atmosphere, and NASA has even hosted debates on the subject. Several potential methods for the terraforming of Mars may be within humanity's technological capabilities, but according to Martin Beech, the economic attitude of preferring short-term profits over long-term investments will not support a terraforming project.\nThe long timescales and practicality of terraforming are also the subject of debate. As the subject has gained traction, research has expanded to other possibilities including biological terraforming, para-terraforming, and modifying humans to better suit the environments of planets and moons. Despite this, questions still remain in areas relating to the ethics, logistics, economics, politics, and methodology of altering the environment of an extraterrestrial world, presenting issues to the implementation of the concept.",

A pair of them provided 85% of the Space Shuttle's thrust at liftoff and for the first two minutes of ascent. After burnout, they were jettisoned, and parachuted into the Atlantic Ocean, where they were recovered, examined, refurbished, and reused.\nThe Space Shuttle SRBs were the most powerful solid rocket motors to ever launch humans. The Space Launch System (SLS) SRBs, adapted from the shuttle, surpassed it as the most powerful solid rocket motors ever flown, after the launch of the Artemis 1 mission in 2022. Each Space Shuttle SRB provided a maximum 14.7 MN (3,300,000 lbf) thrust, roughly double the most powerful single-combustion chamber liquid-propellant rocket engine ever flown, the Rocketdyne F-1. With a combined mass of about 1,180 metric tons (2,600,000 lb), they comprised over half the mass of the Shuttle stack at liftoff.\nThe motor segments of the SRBs were manufactured by Thiokol of Brigham City, Utah, which was later purchased by Alliant Techsystems (ATK). The prime contractor for the integration of all the components and retrieval of the spent SRBs, was United Space Boosters Inc., a subsidiary of Pratt & Whitney. The contract was subsequently transitioned to United Space Alliance, a joint venture of Boeing and Lockheed Martin.\nOut of 270 SRBs launched over the Shuttle program, all but four were recovered – those from STS-4 (due to a parachute malfunction) and STS-51-L (terminated by the range during the Challenger disaster). Over 5,000 parts were refurbished for reuse after each flight. The final set of SRBs that launched STS-135 included parts that had flown on 59 previous missions, including STS-1. Recovery also allowed post-flight examination of the boosters, identification of anomalies, and incremental design improvements.",

      "content": "The primary physical mechanism governing the production of sub-micron sea\nspray aerosols (SSA) -- specifically the competition between film and jet\ndroplets from bubble bursting -- has remained a subject of intense debate. This\nwork presents a revised, first-principles model that establishes the\noverwhelming dominance of jetting for producing micron and sub-micron aerosols.\nOur approach first rules out the film droplet mechanism as a primary\ncontributor for this size range by demonstrating through physical scaling and\nnumerical simulations that the final average ejected volume of sub-micron\ndroplets is much smaller than that from jetting. A comprehensive global\nprobability distribution function (PDF) for SSA is constructed by rigorously\nmodeling its fundamental components in sequence: (i) refining the sub-surface\nbubble size distribution with a simpler and better experimentally supported\nexponential law, and (ii) deriving consistent number and size distribution\nmodels of droplets per bursting event from an ample set of high-resolution\nnumerical simulations. The droplet size PDF from a single bubble follows a\nhighly-skewed distribution -- optimally modeled by a Generalized Inverse\nGaussian distribution -- revealing the production of nanometric droplets\npreviously unaccounted for by simpler models. When integrated, these components\nyield a final predictive model for the global SSA size distribution, with\nparameters derived directly from physical principles and simulations rather\nthan empirical fitting. The model demonstrates extraordinary predictive\naccuracy, aligning almost perfectly with experimental data from both laboratory\nand oceanic measurements, in particular across the critical 25 nm to 2.5 $\\mu$m\nrange. This research significantly enhances the fundamental understanding of\nmarine aerosol generation and provides a more accurate foundation for climate\nand atmospheric chemistry models.",

The term cosmology was first used in English in 1656 in Thomas Blount's Glossographia, with the meaning of \"a speaking of the world\". In 1731, German philosopher Christian Wolff used the term cosmology in Latin (cosmologia) to denote a branch of metaphysics that deals with the general nature of the physical world. Religious or mythological cosmology is a body of beliefs based on mythological, religious, and esoteric literature and traditions of creation myths and eschatology. In the science of astronomy, cosmology is concerned with the study of the chronology of the universe.\nPhysical cosmology is the study of the observable universe's origin, its large-scale structures and dynamics, and the ultimate fate of the universe, including the laws of science that govern these areas. It is investigated by scientists, including astronomers and physicists, as well as philosophers, such as metaphysicians, philosophers of physics, and philosophers of space and time. Because of this shared scope with philosophy, theories in physical cosmology may include both scientific and non-scientific propositions and may depend upon assumptions that cannot be tested. Physical cosmology is a sub-branch of astronomy that is concerned with the universe as a whole. Modern physical cosmology is dominated by the Big Bang Theory which attempts to bring together observational astronomy and particle physics; more specifically, a standard parameterization of the Big Bang with dark matter and dark energy, known as the Lambda-CDM model.\nTheoretical astrophysicist David N. Spergel has described cosmology as a \"historical science\" because \"when we look out in space, we look back in time\" due to the finite nature of the speed of light.",

Previous observations of the\ntemperate sub-Neptune K2-18 b revealed an H2-dominated atmosphere rich in CH4,\nwith moderate evidence for CO2 and tentative signs of dimethyl sulfide (DMS).\nHere we present four new JWST/NIRSpec transit observations of K2-18 b. The\nresulting high-precision transmission spectrum robustly detects both CH4 and\nCO2, precisely measuring their abundances and firmly establishing the planet's\nwater-rich nature: either a thick envelope with >10% H2O by volume or a thin\natmosphere above a liquid-water ocean. The spectrum reveals no detectable H2O,\nNH3, or CO. The absence of atmospheric water vapor suggests an efficient cold\ntrap, while the nondetections of NH3 and CO support the scenario of a small\nH2-rich atmosphere overlying a liquid reservoir. However, alternative models\nthat include these gases can also reproduce the spectrum within uncertainties,\nhighlighting the need for deeper observations. The spectrum only contains\nmarginal signals of DMS, methyl mercaptan (CH3SH), and nitrous oxide (N2O),\nwith none exceeding 3 sigma in model preference and all falling below ~2 sigma\nwithout imposing a strong super-Rayleigh haze. Meanwhile, our self-consistent\nphotochemical models show that DMS and CH3SH may form abiotically in massive\nH2-rich atmospheres of high metallicity, making it important to consider\nadditional indicators for their potential use as biosignatures. K2-18 b, a\ncool, water-rich world, stands out as one of the most promising temperate\nsub-Neptunes for exploring the emergence of liquid-water environments in\nnon-Earth-like planets, motivating further characterization of its atmosphere\nand interior.",

They are commonly observed in the gas phase toward star-forming\nregions, but their detection in ices remains limited. Combining gas-phase\nobservations with chemical modeling is therefore essential for advancing our\nunderstanding of their chemistry. In this paper we investigate the factors that\npromote or hinder molecular complexity combining gas-phase observations of\nCH$_{3}$OH, H$_{2}$S, OCS, N$_{2}$H$^{+}$, and C$^{18}$O with chemical modeling\nin two dense cores: Barnard-1b and IC348. We observed millimeter emission lines\nof CH$_{3}$OH, H$_{2}$S, OCS, N$_{2}$H$^{+}$, and C$^{18}$O along strips using\nthe IRAM 30m and Yebes 40m telescopes. We used the gas-grain chemical model\n\\texttt{Nautilus} to reproduce the observed abundance profiles adjusting\nparameters such as initial sulfur abundances and binding energies. H$_{2}$S,\nN$_{2}$H$^{+}$ and C$^{18}$O gas-phase abundances vary up to one order of\nmagnitude towards the extinction peak. CH$_{3}$OH abundance remains quite\nuniform. These abundances can only be reproduced assuming a decreasing sulfur\nbudget, which lowers H$_{2}$S and enhances CH$_{3}$OH abundances. Decreasing\nbinding energies, which are expected in CO-rich apolar ices, are also required.\nThe sulfur depletion required by H$_2$S is generally higher than that required\nby CH$_3$OH, suggesting unknown sulfur sinks. These findings highlight the\nintricate relationship between sulfur chemistry and COM formation, driven by\nthe competition between sulfur and CO for hydrogen atoms. Our study emphasizes\nthat the growth of CO ice and the progressive sequestration of hydrogen atoms\nby sulfur are critical in determining whether chemical complexity can develop,\nproviding key insights into the early stages of star and planet formation.",

In this framework, we\npresent VLT/MUSE snapshot observations (45 min/source) of 59 $z\\sim3$ quasars\nextending the long-term QSO MUSEUM campaign to fainter SDSS sources. The whole\nsurvey now targets 120 quasars with a median redshift of $z$=3.13, and\nbolometric luminosities, black hole masses and Eddington ratios of\n$45.1<\\log(L_{\\rm bol}/[{\\rm erg\\,s^{-1}]})<48.7$, $7.9<\\log(M_{\\rm BH}/[{\\rm\nM_{\\odot}]})<10.3 $ and $0.01<\\lambda_{\\rm Edd}<1.8$, respectively.

The optical and UV spectra of BL Lacs are\nnearly featureless, making it difficult to precisely determine their redshifts.\nConsequently, nearly half of the {\\gamma}-ray BL Lacs lack reliable redshift\nmeasurements. This poses a major challenge, since redshift is crucial for\nstudying the cosmic evolution of the blazar population and {\\gamma}-ray\npropagation studies such as indirect evidence of EBL, placing constraints on\nIGMF and searches for LIV and ALPs. This paper is the fourth in a series\ndedicated to determining the redshift of a sample of blazars identified as key\ntargets for future observations with the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory\n(CTAO). We performed Monte Carlo simulations to select {\\gamma}-ray blazars\ndetected by Fermi-LAT with hard spectra, that lack redshift measurements. These\nblazars are expected to be detectable by CTAO within 30 hours or less of\nexposure assuming an average flux state. In this fourth paper, we report the\nresults of detailed spectroscopic observations of 29 blazars using the ESO/VLT,\nKeck II, and SALT telescopes. Our analysis involved a thorough search for\nspectral lines in the spectra of each blazar, and when features of the host\ngalaxy were identified, we modeled its properties. We also compared the\nmagnitudes of the targets during the observations to their long-term light\ncurves. In the sample studied, 9 of 29 sources were observed with a high\nsignal-to-noise ratio (S/N > 100), while the remaining 20 were observed with a\nmoderate or low S/N. We successfully determined firm redshifts for 12 blazars,\nranging from 0.1636 to 1.1427, and identified two lower limit redshifts at z >\n1.0196 and z > 1.4454.

      "content": "Accurate acquisition of high-resolution surface meteorological conditions is\ncritical for forecasting and simulating meteorological variables. Directly\napplying spatial interpolation methods to derive meteorological values at\nspecific locations from low-resolution grid fields often yields results that\ndeviate significantly from the actual conditions. Existing downscaling methods\nprimarily rely on the coupling relationship between geostationary satellites\nand ERA5 variables as a condition. However, using brightness temperature data\nfrom geostationary satellites alone fails to comprehensively capture all the\nchanges in meteorological variables in ERA5 maps. To address this limitation,\nwe can use a wider range of satellite data to make more full use of its\ninversion effects on various meteorological variables, thus producing more\nrealistic results across different meteorological variables. To further improve\nthe accuracy of downscaling meteorological variables at any location, we\npropose the Multi-source Observation Down-Scaling Model (MODS). It is a\nconditional diffusion model that fuses data from multiple geostationary\nsatellites GridSat, polar-orbiting satellites (AMSU-A, HIRS, and MHS), and\ntopographic data (GEBCO), as conditions, and is pre-trained on the ERA5\nreanalysis dataset. During training, latent features from diverse conditional\ninputs are extracted separately and fused into ERA5 maps via a multi-source\ncross-attention module. By exploiting the inversion relationships between\nreanalysis data and multi-source atmospheric variables, MODS generates\natmospheric states that align more closely with real-world conditions. During\nsampling, MODS enhances downscaling consistency by incorporating low-resolution\nERA5 maps and station-level meteorological data as guidance. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that MODS achieves higher fidelity when downscaling ERA5\nmaps to a 6.25 km resolution.",

In order to overcome the radial velocity (RV) precision barrier\nimposed by stellar variability, there has been a surge of software aimed at\nsimulating and modeling these activity patterns. Aims. We present Analyzing\nRadial Velocity Elements (ARVE), a Python-based software which enables RV\nextraction using various customizable techniques, and subsequent analysis of\nthe stellar and planetary signals present in the RVs. One of ARVE's unique\nfeatures is its library of pre-computed auxiliary data, which includes\nsynthetic spectra and spectral line masks, allowing the code to efficiently\nperform certain routines with minimal input from the user. Methods. ARVE is a\nclass-based and modular code in which its functionalities are divided between\nfour subclasses: functions, which handles general functions utilized by the\nother subclasses; data, which reads the input data, loads the auxiliary data,\nand extracts RVs from input high-resolution spectra; star, which characterizes\nthe stellar activity components present in the RV time series; and planets,\nwhich performs fits of Keplerian signals in the data and offers\ninjection-recovery tests of fictitious planets to determine the detection\nlimits. Results. Demonstrations of ARVE are performed on three years of HARPS-N\nsolar data. We show the evolution of granulation and supergranulation\ncharacteristic timescales with activity level, and we investigate the\ndifferences in planetary period-mass detection limits when extracting RVs with\ndifferent methods. Conclusions. As stellar activity mitigation techniques grow\nmore diverse, we foresee that a tool like ARVE could greatly benefit the\ncommunity by offering a user-friendly and multi-functional approach to extract\nand analyze RV time series. With its current code structure, expanded\nfunctionality and increased compatibility with more spectrographs should be\neasily addable to future versions of ARVE.",

      "content": "Protoplanetary discs around Very Low Mass Stars (VLMS) show hydrocarbon-rich\nMIR spectra indicative of C/O>1 in their inner discs, in contrast to discs\naround higher-mass hosts which mostly show O-bearing species. One scenario\nproposed to elevate C/O in VLMS inner discs is the advection of O-depleted gas\nfrom the outer disc. However, if CO gas remains abundant, C/O can be at most\n~1. We test if chemical transformation of CO into other species allows this\ntransport scenario to produce C/O significantly above 1. We track the evolving\ninner disc C/H and O/H with a 1D disc evolution code. We model the transport of\nmolecules in gas and ice and add conversions of species to represent key\nreaction pathways at the midplane. We explore the role of disc mass, size,\nionization rate, and substructures. The inner disc C/O increases over time due\nto sequential delivery where O-rich species (e.g. H2O) give way to C-rich\nspecies (e.g. CH4). To reach C/O>1, separating C and O is key, hence the\nliberation of C from gaseous CO by He+ is critical. Ionization drives this\nchemistry and needs rates >~10^-17 s^-1 for VLMSs for sufficient chemical\nevolution within a disc lifetime. However, <~10^-17 s^-1 is needed to ensure\nthat C/O stays <1 for the first few Myr in T Tauri discs. While C/O is usually\nhigher for VLMS than T Tauri stars due to faster sequential delivery, C/O\nsignificantly above 1 is only produced by combining gas-phase CO destruction\nwith gas advection and radial drift. Sufficient O depletion and hydrocarbon\nproduction around VLMSs can then be achieved but may imply higher ionization\nrates than T Tauris. Observations of older discs may distinguish whether higher\nionization rates are indeed needed or faster physical evolution timescales\nalone are sufficient. CH3OH ice photodissociation at a dust trap between the\nCH3OH and CH4 snowlines may also liberate C as CH4 gas that can enrich the\ninner disc.",

The vertical shear instability (VSI) is one of the candidate\nturbulence-driving mechanisms in the outer disk region. Since the VSI requires\nrapid gas cooling, dust grains in disks can influence and potentially control\nVSI-driven turbulence. However, VSI-driven turbulence has strong vertical\nmotion, causing vertical dust diffusion. As a result, it remains unclear how\nturbulent structures and dust distributions form. We aim to clarify whether the\nVSI can achieve a quasi-steady dust profile under cooling rate evolution\nassociated with turbulently diffusing dust. We also elucidate the dependence of\nthe dust size and dust-to-gas mass ratio on the realization and persistence of\nthe equilibrium state. We perform global two-dimensional hydrodynamical\nsimulations of an axisymmetric disk to investigate how the VSI drives\nturbulence and maintains a balance between dust settling and diffusion. These\nsimulations account for the dynamic interplay between dust distribution,\ncooling rates, and turbulence. We find that VSI mixing, dust settling, and\nlocal cooling reach an equilibrium, forming a thick dust layer with a\ndimensionless vertical mixing coefficient of approximately 10^{-3}. The ability\nof the VSI to sustain this state also depends on the dust size and dust-to-gas\nmass ratio. Larger grains or lower mass ratios weaken turbulence, leading to\ndust settling. The condition of equilibrium state existence is consistent with\nthe prediction of the semi-analytic model presented by Fukuhara & Okuzumi\n(2024). Our results indicate that efficient turbulent dust mixing and efficient\ncooling can occur simultaneously.

In practice, two-parameter spectra based on significant wave height and\nenergy period are ubiquitous. Two-parameter spectra have been shown\ninsufficient in capturing the range of spectral shapes that can occur in an\nactual ocean environment. Furthermore, through sensitivity analysis, these\ntwo-parameters have been shown to be insufficient for predicting power\nperformance of WECs. Four parameter spectra, which expand the parameter space\nto include two additional shape parameters have been shown sufficient in\ncapturing sea state variance, but their effect on mean power estimates has not\nbeen presented. This work directly looks at the effects of incorporating\n4-parameter spectra into annual power estimates compared to using the\ntraditional 2-parameter spectra. We use two different 4-parameter spectra: one\nfrom the literature and a novel machine learning-based autoencoder, presented\nhere. Both are shown to improve the information retained when parameterizing\nspectra. The site-specific autoencoder performs consistently the best across\ntwo case studies of mean annual power prediction, achieving an error around 1%\nin each instance. The 2-parameter spectra resulted in less consistent\npredictive performance, with errors of -8% and 1% in the two case studies. For\nthe case study where all three models performed well, it is shown that the low\nerror in the 2-parameter model is attributable to a symmetrical distribution of\nlarge errors whereas both 4-parameter spectra result in relatively low errors\nthroughout the parametric space. These results highlight the need for more\nsophisticated resource characterization methods for estimating the power\nperformance of WECs and suggest site-specific machine learning-based spectra\nare an adequate option.",

      "content": "The ionospheric Pedersen and Hall conductances play an important role in\nunderstanding the exchanges of angular momentum, energy and matter between the\nmagnetosphere and the ionosphere/thermosphere at Jupiter, modifying the\ncomposition and temperature of the planet. In the high latitude regions, these\nconductances are enhanced by the auroral electron precipitation. The effect of\na broadband precipitating electron energy distribution, similar to the observed\nelectron distributions through particle measurements, on the conductance values\nis investigated. The new values are compared to the ones obtained from previous\nstudies, notably when considering a mono-energetic distribution. The broadband\nprecipitating electron energy distribution is modeled by a kappa distribution,\nwhich is used as an input in an electron transport model that computes the\ndensity vertical profiles of ionospheric ions. The vertical profiles of the\nPedersen and Hall conductivities are then evaluated assuming that the\nconductivities are mostly governed by the densities of H3+ and CH5+. Finally,\nthe Pedersen and Hall conductances are computed by integrating the\ncorresponding conductivities over altitude. The Pedersen and Hall conductances\nare globally higher when considering a broadband electron energy distribution\nrather than a mono-energetic distribution. In addition, the use of the direct\noutputs of an electron transport model rather than the analytical expression\npresented in Hiraki and Tao (2008) as well as a change in the electron\ncollision cross-sections also have significant impacts on the conductance\nvalues. Comparison between our results and the ones deduced from the corotation\nenforcement theory suggests that either a physical mechanism limits the\nfield-aligned currents or the auroral electrons precipitating in the atmosphere\nare also accelerated by processes not associated with the field-aligned\ncurrents.",

      "content": "A significant fraction of the energy from the $\\gamma$-ray burst (GRB) jets,\nafter powering the keV-MeV emission, forms an ultra-relativistic shock\npropagating into the circumburst medium. The particles in the medium accelerate\nthrough the shock and produce afterglow emission. Recently, a few GRB\nafterglows have been observed in TeV $\\gamma$-rays by Cherenkov Telescopes.\nThis provides access to broadband spectra of GRB afterglows containing rich\ninformation about the microphysics of relativistic shocks and the profile of\nthe circumburst medium. Since the transition from synchrotron to inverse\nCompton regime in afterglow spectra occurs between hard X-rays and the\nvery-high-energy (VHE) $\\gamma$-rays, detection in one of these bands is\nrequired to identify the two spectral components. The early afterglow data in\nthe hard X-rays, along with the GeV emission, could accurately constrain the\nspectral shape and help in capturing the spectral turnover to distinguish the\ntwo components. We present the multiwavelength spectral and temporal study,\nfocused on the keV-VHE domain, of GRB 230812B, one of the brightest GRBs\ndetected by Fermi Gamma Ray Burst Monitor (GBM), along with the detection of a\n72 GeV photon in Large Area Telescope (LAT) during the early afterglow phase.\nThrough a detailed modelling of the emission within the afterglow external\nforward shock in a wind-like scenario, we predict optical to high-energy\nobservations up to ~1 day. We emphasize the importance of following up poorly\nlocalised GRBs by demonstrating that even without prompt sub-degree\nlocalisation, such as in GRB 230812B, it is possible to recover the emission\nusing imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes, thanks to their relatively\nwider field of view. Moreover, we show that the low energy threshold of\nLarge-Sized Telescope is essential in discovering the VHE component at much\nhigher redshifts, typical of long GRBs.",

Wd1-9 exhibits significant long-term X-ray variability,\nwithin which we identify a strong 14-day periodic signal. We interpret this as\nthe orbital period, marking the first period determination for the system. The\nX-ray spectrum of Wd1-9 is thermal and hard (kT approximately 3.0 keV),\nresembling the spectra of bright Wolf-Rayet (WR) binaries in Wd1, while a\nstrong Fe emission line at 6.7 keV indicates hot plasma from a colliding-wind\nX-ray binary. Wd1-9, with evidence of past mass loss, circumbinary material, a\nhard X-ray spectrum, and a newly detected 14-day period, displays all the\nhallmarks of a binary--likely a WR+OB--that recently underwent early Case B\nmass transfer. Its sgB[e] classification is likely phenomenological reflecting\nemission from the dense circumbinary material.

To provide a computationally efficient alternative, we introduce\nHRRRCast, a data-driven emulator built with advanced machine learning\ntechniques. HRRRCast includes two architectures: a ResNet-based model (ResHRRR)\nand a Graph Neural Network-based model (GraphHRRR). ResHRRR uses convolutional\nneural networks enhanced with squeeze-and-excitation blocks and Feature-wise\nLinear Modulation, and supports probabilistic forecasting via the Denoising\nDiffusion Implicit Model (DDIM). To better handle longer lead times, we train a\nsingle model to predict multiple lead times (1h, 3h, and 6h), then use a greedy\nrollout strategy during inference. When evaluated on composite reflectivity\nover the full CONUS domain using ensembles of 3 to 10 members, ResHRRR\noutperforms HRRR forecast at light rainfall threshold (20 dBZ) and achieves\ncompetitive performance at moderate thresholds (30 dBZ). Our work advances the\nStormCast model of Pathak et al. [21] by: a) training on the full CONUS domain,\nb) using multiple lead times to improve long-range skill, c) training on\nanalysis data instead of the +1h post-analysis data inadvertently used in\nStormCast, and d) incorporating future GFS states as inputs, enabling\ndownscaling that improves long-lead accuracy. Grid-, neighborhood-, and\nobject-based metrics confirm better storm placement, lower frequency bias, and\nhigher success ratios than HRRR. HRRRCast ensemble forecasts also maintain\nsharper spatial detail, with power spectra more closely matching HRRR analysis.\nWhile GraphHRRR underperforms in its current form, it lays groundwork for\nfuture graph-based forecasting.

      "content": "The latest detection of GW231123, a binary black hole (BH) merger with\nexceptionally large masses and high spins for the incoming components, has been\nsuggested as a smoking gun for hierarchical formation. In this scenario, a\nfirst generation of BHs resulting from collapsing stars form in a dense\nenvironment. Here they can assemble dynamically and undergo subsequent mergers.\nWe discuss three challenges for the formation of a GW231123-like event inside a\nstar cluster: 1) The high masses of the incoming BHs appear to be in the\npredicted pair-instability mass gap and thus suggest that second-generation or\nhigher-order generation BHs are involved. 2) Very high spins ($\\chi_f \\gtrsim\n0.8$) are very unlikely for dynamically assembled BHs because of the isotropic\ndistribution of spin vectors. 3) Hierarchically formed BHs are susceptible to\nreceive large recoils, which could kick them out of their cluster. We simulate\nthis scenario and show that only a few percent of mergers recover remnants\nwithin GW231123's primary spin estimate $\\chi_1=0.9^{+0.10}_{-0.19}$ and are\nretained inside typical star clusters. A large fraction of very rapidly\nspinning second-generation BHs (including $\\chi_f>0.9$) can only form if the\nfirst-generation BHs merges with aligned spins. This is a natural outcome of\nmassive binary star evolution scenarios, such as a chemically homogeneous\nevolution. This scenario also predicts equal masses for the components,\nimplying that the resulting BHs tend to receive very low recoil kicks and would\ntherefore likely be retained inside a cluster. We conclude that GW231123-like\nevents, if formed in a star cluster, could require first-generation BHs with\nlarge aligned spins that evolved through stellar binary interaction, followed\nby the dynamical assembly for a subsequent merger.

Infrared observations have recently shown that large PAHs\npresent in UV-illuminated regions are strongly enriched in deuterium. In order\nto shed light on the origin of PAHs in cold clouds, we have searched for\ndeuterated benzonitrile in the cold dark cloud TMC-1. To that purpose we have\nsynthesized the three isomers (ortho, meta, and para) of monodeuterated\nbenzonitrile, measured their rotational spectra across the 2-18 GHz and 75-110\nGHz frequency ranges in the laboratory, and searched for them in TMC-1 using\ndata from the QUIJOTE line survey. We did not detect any of the three species\nand have derived a 3sigma upper limit on the column density of each of them of\n3.0e10 cm-2, meaning a fractional abundance relative to H2 of <3e-12. We\nderived a D/H ratio (which we define as the total number of D atoms with\nrespect to the total number of H atoms present in benzonitrile) of <1.2 %. This\nvalue is in line with the range of D/H ratios observed for other molecules in\nTMC-1 (0.06-3.3 %), where deuterium enrichment is explained in terms of\nisotopic fractionation at low temperature. It is however below the range of D/H\nratios derived for large unspecific PAHs from JWST observations of the galactic\nPDRs Orion Bar and M17 and the galaxies M51 and NGC3256-S (between 1% and\n<17%). Although it is not straightforward to compare the deuteration of PAHs in\ndark and UV-irradiated clouds, our results suggest that the population of PAHs\ndetected in cold dark clouds does not result from the fragmentation of larger\nPAHs inherited from the previous diffuse stage in a top-down scenario.",

Testing its validity offers a powerful tool to probe\nnew physics beyond the standard cosmological model. In this work, for the first\ntime, we present a novel consistency test of CDDR by combining HII galaxy data\nwith a comprehensive set of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) measurements.\nThe BAO measurements include two-dimensional (2D) BAO and three-dimensional\n(3D) BAO, as well as the latest 3D BAO data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic\nInstrument (DESI) Data Release 2 (DR2). We adopt four different\nparameterizations of the CDDR parameter, $\\eta(z)$, to investigate possible\ndeviations and their evolution with cosmic time. To ensure accurate redshift\nmatching across datasets, we reconstruct the distance measures through a\nmodel-independent Artificial Neural Network (ANN) approach. Our analysis\nuniquely examines two distinct approaches: $i)$ marginalization over the BAO\nsound horizon $r_d$, and $ii)$ fixing $r_d$ to specific values. We find no\nsignificant deviation from the CDDR (less than 68% confidence level) in either\nthe marginalized $r_d$ or the $r_d=147.05$ Mpc scenario. However, a slight\ndeviation at the 68% confidence level is found when applying 2D-BAO data with\n$r_d=139.5$ Mpc. Furthermore, our analysis shows that all BAO data considered\nin this work support the validity of the CDDR, where 3D-DESI BAO provides the\ntightest constraints. We find no tension between 2D and 3D BAO measurements,\nwhich confirms their mutual consistency. In addition, the treatment of the\nsound horizon $r_d$ significantly impacts $\\eta(z)$ constraints, which proves\nits importance in CDDR tests.

Most of the\nBayesian deep learning methods produced probabilistic forecasts that\noutperformed the deterministic ResNet, with one, the initial-weights ensemble +\nMonte Carlo (MC) dropout, an ensemble of deterministic ResNets with different\ninitial weights to start training and dropout activated during inference,\nproducing the most skillful and well-calibrated forecasts. The initial-weights\nensemble + MC dropout benefited from generating multiple solutions that more\nthoroughly sampled the hypothesis space. The Bayesian ResNet ensemble was the\nonly one that performed worse than the deterministic ResNet at longer lead\ntimes, likely due to the challenge of optimizing a larger number of parameters.\nTo address this issue, the Bayesian-MOPED (MOdel Priors with Empirical Bayes\nusing Deep neural network) ResNet ensemble was adopted, and it enhanced\nforecast skill by constraining the hypothesis search near the deterministic\nResNet hypothesis. All Bayesian methods demonstrated well-calibrated\nuncertainty and effectively separated cases with large and small errors. In\ncase studies, the initial-weights ensemble + MC dropout demonstrated better\nforecast skill than the Bayesian-MOPED ensemble and the deterministic ResNet on\nselected CI events in clear-sky regions. However, the initial-weights ensemble\n+ MC dropout exhibited poorer generalization in clear-sky and anvil cloud\nregions without CI occurrence compared to the deterministic ResNet and\nBayesian-MOPED ensemble.",

In this work, we study a\nserendipitously discovered large overdensity of HI galaxies at z~0.04. The\ngalaxies appear to lie in a filamentary-like structure of megaparsec scale.\nMeerKAT's angular resolution and field of view allow us to spatially resolve\nthe HI galaxies while simultaneously probing large-scale structure. The HI and\nsub-arcsec Dark Energy Survey (DES) imaging reveal a large number of\ninteracting galaxies in this collective group. MeerKAT data enables us to\nderive HI masses and investigate interacting galaxies. We use DES and\nWide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) data to quantify the star formation\nrates, stellar masses, and stellar morphologies of member galaxies and compare\nthese with field scaling relations. To place this discovery and the\nenvironmental effects in context, we use the SIMBA simulation to investigate\nthe prevalence of qualitatively similar HI overdensities and their large-scale\nmorphological properties. This enables a prediction of how frequently such\nstructures might be serendipitously discovered with MeerKAT and SKA-Mid HI\nobservations in comparable observation time. The combination of spatially\nresolved HI data and optical imaging reveals a group rich in interactions,\nsuggesting environmental processes are already shaping galaxy properties within\nthe structure.

Near the acceleration\nregion, high-energy leptons produce synchrotron (mini)halos and sometimes\nobservable gamma rays, but these leptons have short lifetimes and so cannot\npropagate far from sources without some rejuvenation. However, low-energy\n(~0.1-1 GeV) CRs should survive for >Gyr, potentially reaching ~100 kpc before\nlosing energy via inverse-Compton (IC) scattering of CMB photons to keV X-ray\nenergies, with remarkably thermal X-ray spectra. In groups/clusters, this will\nappear similar to relatively 'cool' gas in cluster cores (i.e. CCs). In\nlower-mass (e.g. Milky Way/M31) halos, analogous CR IC emission will appear as\nhot (super-virial) gas at outer CGM radii, explaining recent diffuse X-ray\nobservations. We show that for plausible (radio/gamma-ray observed) lepton\ninjection rates, the CR-IC emission could contribute significantly to the X-ray\nsurface brightness (SB) in CCs, implying that CC gas densities may have been\noverestimated and alleviating the cooling flow problem. A significant IC\ncontribution to diffuse X-ray emission in CC clusters also explains the tight\ncorrelation between the X-ray 'cooling luminosity' and AGN/cavity/jet power,\nbecause the apparent CC emission is itself driven by the radio source.\nComparing observed Sunyaev Zeldovich to X-ray inferred pressures at $\\ll 100$\nkpc in CCs represents a clean test of this scenario, and existing data appears\nto favor significant CR-IC. A significant IC contribution also implies that\nX-ray inferred gas-phase metallicities have been underestimated in CCs,\npotentially explaining the discrepancy between X-ray (sub-Solar) and optical/UV\n(super-Solar) observed metallicities in the central ~10 kpc of nearby CCs.

      "content": "The process of bar formation, evolution and destruction is still a\ncontroversial topic regarding galaxy dynamics. Numerical simulations show that\nthese phenomena strongly depend on physical and numerical parameters. In this\nwork, we study the combined influence of the softening parameter, $\\epsilon$\nand disc mass fraction, $m_{\\mathrm{d}}$ on the formation and evolution of bars\nin isolated disc-halo models via $N$-body simulations with different particle\nresolutions. Previous studies indicate that the bar strength depends on\n$m_{\\mathrm{d}}$ as $\\propto m_{\\mathrm{d}}^{-1}$, which is seen as a delay in\nbar formation. However, the distorsion parameter, $\\eta$, which measures the\nbar's momentum through time, shows that an increase in $m_{\\mathrm{d}}$ does\nnot always induce a delay in bar formation. This suggests that $\\epsilon$\ninteract to either enhance or weaken the bar. Moreover, numerical heating\ndominates in models with small softening values, creating highly accelerated\nparticles at the centre of discs, regardless of $m_{\\mathrm{d}}$ or resolution.\nThese enhanced particle accelerations produce chaotic orbits for $\\epsilon \\leq\n5\\,$pc, resulting in bar suppression due to collisional dynamics in the centre.\nIn our high resolution models ($N \\approx 10^{7}$), small softening values are\nincapable of reproducing the bar instability. The role of disc mass is as\nfollows: increasing $m_{\\mathrm{d}}$ for moderate $\\epsilon$ ($\\geq 10\\,$pc)\nreduces the amount of drift in the acceleration profile, without affecting the\nbar's behaviour. Models with lower $m_{\\mathrm{d}}$ values coupled with small\nsoftening values, have an excess of highly accelerated particles, introducing\nunwanted effects into otherwise reliable simulations. Finally, we show that the\nevolution of the disc's vertical acceleration profile is a reliable indicator\nof numerical heating introduced by $\\epsilon$ and the bar.",

While their individual dynamics have been\nwidely studied, their coupled interactions, particularly in the context of ENSO\ncomplexity, including spatial diversity (Central Pacific vs. Eastern Pacific\nevents), temporal evolution (single-year and multi-year events), and intensity\nvariations (moderate to extreme events), have received limited attention in\nmodeling studies. In this paper, a simple intermediate coupled MJO-ENSO model\nis developed to address critical gaps in understanding their bidirectional\nfeedback and its role in modulating ENSO complexity. The model integrates\nmultiscale processes, bridging intraseasonal (MJO), interannual (ENSO), and\ndecadal (Walker circulation) variability. Key mechanisms include: (1)\ninterannual SST modulating MJO through latent heat and background states, (2)\nMJO-induced wind forcing triggering diverse ENSO events, and (3) decadal\nvariability modulating the strength and occurrence frequency of Eastern Pacific\nand Central Pacific events. Effective stochastic parameterizations are\nincorporated to improve the characterization of multiscale MJO-ENSO\ninteractions and the emergence of intermittency and extremes. The model\ncaptures several crucial observed MJO and ENSO features, including non-Gaussian\nstatistics, seasonal cycles, energy spectra, and spatial event patterns. It\nalso reproduces critical MJO-ENSO interactions: warm pool edge extension,\nconvective activity adjustments that modulate SST, and ENSO's dependence on\nMJO-driven easterly and westerly wind anomalies.

      "content": "The ions and electrons of a plasma interacting with the Earth's magnetic field generally follow its magnetic field lines.  These represent the force that a north magnetic pole would experience at any given point.  (Denser lines indicate a stronger force.)  Plasmas exhibit more complex second-order behaviors, studied as part of magnetohydrodynamics.\n\nThus in the \"closed\" model of the magnetosphere, the magnetopause boundary between the magnetosphere and the solar wind is outlined by field lines. Not much plasma can cross such a stiff boundary. Its only \"weak points\" are the two polar cusps, the points where field lines closing at noon (-z axis GSM) get separated from those closing at midnight (+z axis GSM); at such points the field intensity on the boundary is zero, posing no barrier to the entry of plasma. (This simple definition assumes a noon-midnight plane of symmetry, but closed fields lacking such symmetry also must have cusps, by the fixed point theorem.)\nThe amount of solar wind energy and plasma entering the actual magnetosphere depends on how far it departs from such a \"closed\" configuration, i.e. the extent to which Interplanetary Magnetic Field field lines manage to cross the boundary. As discussed further below, that extent depends very much on the direction of the Interplanetary Magnetic Field, in particular on its southward or northward slant.\n\nTrapping of plasma, e.g. of the ring current, also follows the structure of field lines. A particle interacting with this B field experiences a Lorentz Force which is responsible for many of the particle motion in the magnetosphere.  Furthermore, Birkeland currents and heat flow are also channeled by such lines — easy along them, blocked in perpendicular directions.  Indeed, field lines in the magnetosphere have been likened to the grain in a log of wood, which defines an \"easy\" direction along which it easily gives way.",

The signals are received via an outdoor parabolic antenna commonly referred to as a satellite dish and a low-noise block downconverter.\n\nA satellite receiver decodes the desired television program for viewing on a television set. Receivers can be external set-top boxes, or a built-in television tuner. Satellite television provides a wide range of channels and services. It is usually the only television available in many remote geographic areas without terrestrial television or cable television service. Different receivers are required for the two types. Some transmissions and channels are unencrypted and therefore free-to-air, while many other channels are transmitted with encryption. Free-to-view channels are encrypted but not charged-for, while pay television requires the viewer to subscribe and pay a monthly fee to receive the programming.\nModern systems signals are relayed from a communications satellite on the X band (8–12 GHz) or Ku band (12–18 GHz) frequencies requiring only a small dish less than a meter in diameter. The first satellite TV systems were a now-obsolete type known as television receive-only. These systems received weaker analog signals transmitted in the C-band (4–8 GHz) from FSS type satellites, requiring the use of large 2–3-meter dishes. Consequently, these systems were nicknamed \"big dish\" systems, and were more expensive and less popular. Early systems used analog signals, but modern ones use digital signals which allow transmission of the modern television standard high-definition television, due to the significantly improved spectral efficiency of digital broadcasting.

Propelled by 4 RS-25 engines, the stage generates approximately 7.44 MN (1,670,000 lbf) of thrust, about 25% of the Space Launch System's thrust at liftoff, for approximately 500 seconds, propelling the stage alone for the last 375 seconds of flight. The stage lifts the rocket to an altitude of approximately 162 km (531,380 ft) before separating, reentering the atmosphere over the Pacific Ocean. \nThe core stage originated in 2011, when the architecture of the Space Launch System as a whole was defined. In the aftermath of the end of the Space Shuttle program and the cancellation of its prospective replacement the Constellation program, the SLS emerged, a super-heavy lift launch vehicle intended for human spaceflight to the Moon. The core stage is the first newly-developed stage of the SLS; the ICPS (Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage) and five-segment boosters are adaptations of existing hardware, to be replaced by the Exploration Upper Stage and BOLE boosters respectively.\nProduction of core stages began by 2014, but was beset by numerous difficulties in production and testing which delayed the readiness of the first core stage by several years. The core stage first flew on November 16, 2022, on the Artemis I mission, in which it performed successfully.

While current\nobservations focus on stellar accretion and inner dust emission, the fate of\nthe volatile-rich material expelled during disruption remains poorly\nunderstood.\n  Aims: We investigate whether the H/He-rich gas expelled from the disrupted\nplanet's envelope and atmosphere can escape the inner system and be\ngravitationally captured by an outer low-mass planet (a volatile-enriched\nplanet, or VEP), potentially forming a transient atmosphere and producing\ndetectable volatile contamination.\n  Methods: We model the outward diffusion of gas from a tidally stripped giant\nusing two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations with FARGO3D, complemented by\nanalytical estimates of volatile observability and atmospheric escape. We\nassess the efficiency of gas capture by outer planets and the survival\ntimescales of the resulting secondary atmospheres under high-energy stellar\nirradiation.\n  Results: Our simulations show that volatile-rich gas can form a VEP. The\nresulting envelopes can contain between 1e-10 and 1e-6 Earth masses, up to the\nmass of Earth's atmosphere, for Earth-like planets, yielding transit depths of\ntens to several hundred ppm.

We infer that 2024\nPT$_5$ is in a tumbling state and has a lightcurve amplitude of about 0.3 mag.\nVisible and near-infrared color indices of 2024 PT$_5$, $g-r=0.567\\pm0.044$,\n$r-i=0.155\\pm0.009$, $r-z=0.147\\pm0.066$, $Y-J=0.557\\pm0.046$,\n$J-H=0.672\\pm0.078$, and $H-Ks=0.148\\pm0.098$, indicate that 2024 PT$_5$ is an\nS-complex asteroid, largely consistent with previous observations. Using the\n$H$-$G$ model, we derived an absolute magnitude $H_{V,HG}$ of $27.72\\pm0.09$\nand a slope parameter $G_V$ of $0.223\\pm0.073$ in V-band. A geometric albedo of\n2024 PT$_5$ is derived to be $0.26\\pm0.07$ from the slope of its photometric\nphase curve. This albedo value is typical of the S- and Q-type NEAs. The color\nproperties of 2024 PT$_5$ derived from our observations match rock samples\ntaken from the lunar surface, which agrees with previous studies.",

We aim to investigate the origin and transport\nof energetic particles in two rare bidirectional anisotropic SEP events\nobserved by Solar Orbiter. Both events showed two clear velocity dispersion\nsignatures with opposite particle anisotropies during their onset phase. The\nsunward streaming protons, characterized by delayed release time, harder\nspectral index, and higher intensities, may be attributed to coronal mass\nejection-driven shock acceleration, while the promptly released anti-sunward\nstreaming protons are likely linked to flare acceleration.

These\ninteractions can be observed at different wavelengths, from X-ray to radio.\nTheir strengths depend on the architecture of planetary systems, as well as the\nage and activity level of the host stars. In particular, exoplanets in close-in\norbits and/or orbiting active host stars can experience strong physical\ninteractions, some of which are negligible or absent in the present-day Solar\nSystem planets. Here, I present an overview of star-planet interactions through\nthe lens of three-dimensional (3D) numerical models. The main conclusions are:\n  * Models are fundamental to interpret and guide observations. The powerful\ncombination of observations and models allows us to extract important physical\nparameters of the system, such as, planetary magnetic fields, stellar wind\nproperties, etc.\n  * The non-axisymmetric forces of the interactions generate spatially\nasymmetric features (e.g., planetary material trailing the orbit, shock\nformation), thus requiring the use of 3D models.\n  * Star-planet interactions vary in different timescales (from hours to\ngiga-years) that are related to both planetary (orbital motion, rotation) and\nstellar (flares, cycles, and long-term evolution) properties. Understanding\nthese variations require time-dependent models.\n  I advocate that future 3D models should be informed by multi-wavelength,\n(near-)simultaneous observations. The use of observations is twofold: some\ngenerate inputs for models (eg stellar magnetic field maps), whereas others are\nfitted by models (eg spectroscopic transits). This combination of observations\nand models provides a powerful tool to derive physical properties of the system\nthat would otherwise remain unknown.",

      "title": "Quantum mechanics of time travel",
      "content": "The theoretical study of time travel generally follows the laws of general relativity. Quantum mechanics requires physicists to solve equations describing how probabilities behave along closed timelike curves (CTCs), which are theoretical loops in spacetime that might make it possible to travel through time.\nIn the 1980s, Igor Novikov proposed the self-consistency principle. According to this principle, any changes made by a time traveler in the past must not create historical paradoxes. If a time traveler attempts to change the past, the laws of physics will ensure that events unfold in a way that avoids paradoxes. This means that while a time traveler can influence past events, those influences must ultimately lead to a consistent historical narrative.\nHowever, Novikov's self-consistency principle has been debated in relation to certain interpretations of quantum mechanics. Specifically, it raises questions about how it interacts with fundamental principles such as unitarity and linearity. Unitarity ensures that the total probability of all possible outcomes in a quantum system always sums to 1, preserving the predictability of quantum events. Linearity ensures that quantum evolution preserves superpositions, allowing quantum systems to exist in multiple states simultaneously.\nThere are two main approaches to explaining quantum time travel while incorporating Novikov's self-consistency principle. The first approach uses density matrices to describe the probabilities of different outcomes in quantum systems, providing a statistical framework that can accommodate the constraints of CTCs. The second approach involves state vectors, which describe the quantum state of a system. Both approaches can lead to insights into how time travel might be reconciled with quantum mechanics, although they may introduce concepts that challenge conventional understandings of these theories.",

Among these, the $\\sim$140 ks\nobservation from 2014 was analyzed in detail for this study. This data provides\nthe best statistics and was taken when the jets were nearly perpendicular to\nthe line of sight and the accretion disk was eclipsed.

Its official program name was Space Transportation System (STS), taken from a 1969 plan for a system of reusable spacecraft where it was the only item funded for development, as a proposed nuclear shuttle in the plan was cancelled in 1972. It flew 135 missions and carried 355 astronauts from 16 countries, many on multiple trips. \nThe Space Shuttle, composed of an orbiter launched with two reusable solid rocket boosters and a disposable external fuel tank, carried up to eight astronauts and up to 50,000 lb (23,000 kg) of payload into low Earth orbit (LEO). When its mission was complete, the orbiter would reenter the Earth's atmosphere and land like a glider at either the Kennedy Space Center or Edwards Air Force Base.\nThe Shuttle is the only winged crewed spacecraft to have achieved orbit and landing, and the first reusable crewed space vehicle that made multiple flights into orbit. Its missions involved carrying large payloads to various orbits including the International Space Station (ISS), providing crew rotation for the space station, and performing service missions on the Hubble Space Telescope. The orbiter also recovered satellites and other payloads (e.g., from the ISS) from orbit and returned them to Earth, though its use in this capacity was rare. Each vehicle was designed with a projected lifespan of 100 launches, or 10 years' operational life. Original selling points on the shuttles were over 150 launches over a 15-year operational span with a 'launch per month' expected at the peak of the program, but extensive delays in the development of the International Space Station never created such a peak demand for frequent flights.",

Previous work suggested that planetesimal\nformation becomes difficult at overall dust-to-gas ratios below 0.6\\%,\nconsistent with the occurrence of close-in super Earths. However, the influence\nof disc composition on planetesimal formation remains unclear. Observations of\nstellar abundances show both a decrease and a wide spread in C/O ratios for\nlow-metallicity stars. Using the C/O ratio as a proxy to determine water ice\nabundance in discs, we use the 1D disc evolution code chemcomp to simulate\nprotoplanetary discs with varying C/O and dust-to-gas ratios over 3 Myr.\nPlanetesimal formation is modeled using conditions based on dust-gas dynamics\nand pebble fragmentation. Our results confirm that planetesimal formation\nstrongly depends on disc metallicity, with lower metallicity discs forming\nsignificantly fewer planetesimals. A lower carbon fraction generally promotes\nplanetesimal formation by increasing water ice, while higher carbon fractions\nsuppress it. The opposite is seen for oxygen: higher oxygen content leads to\nmore efficient planetesimal formation at the same dust-to-gas ratio. We thus\npredict that planets around low-metallicity stars should be more common when\ntheir C/O ratio is low and oxygen is enhanced, a trend that can be tested\nobservationally. Our simulations thus open a pathway to understand if the\ncomposition of the planet forming material influences the growth of planets.",

The first\ncoordinated observations of the Sun by these two facilities occurred over the\ncourse of one week in October 2022. The returned data are open-access and will\nprovide a valuable resource to researchers in the field.\n  We provide an overview of the datasets collected by Solar Orbiter and DKIST\nthrough this coordination and discuss their scientific potential. Our aim is to\ndemonstrate how these unique high-resolution coordinated observations, as well\nas similar observations obtained through subsequent campaigns, can help tackle\nimportant science questions in the field.\n  Between 18 and 24 October 2022, Solar Orbiter and DKIST observed a decayed\nactive region simultaneously. During this period, Solar Orbiter's separation\nangle with Earth decreased from 77{\\deg} to 51{\\deg}, enabling stereoscopic\nobservations with DKIST. From Solar Orbiter, observations are provided by the\nExtreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI), Polarimetric and Helioseismic Imager (PHI),\nand the Spectral Imaging of the Coronal Environment (SPICE) instruments.\nMeanwhile, DKIST observed using the Cryogenic Near Infrared Spectropolarimeter\n(CryoNIRSP), the Visible Broadband Imager (VBI), and the Visible\nSpectropolarimeter (ViSP).\n  The first coordinated Solar Orbiter and DKIST campaign was a success,\ncollecting observations multiple times over the week. We focus on three\nspecific topics as representative examples, namely, coronal loop physics, the\nformation and evolution of the small-scale active region brightenings, and\ncoronal rain dynamics.\n  These open-access observations, and others like them, should help the solar\nphysics community tackle key questions in the field.

      "content": "Regional machine learning weather prediction (MLWP) models based on graph\nneural networks have recently demonstrated remarkable predictive accuracy,\noutperforming numerical weather prediction models at lower computational costs.\nIn particular, limited-area model (LAM) and stretched-grid model (SGM)\napproaches have emerged for generating high-resolution regional forecasts,\nbased on initial conditions from a regional (re)analysis. While LAM uses\nlateral boundaries from an external global model, SGM incorporates a global\ndomain at lower resolution. This study aims to understand how the differences\nin model design impact relative performance and potential applications.\nSpecifically, the strengths and weaknesses of these two approaches are\nidentified for generating deterministic regional forecasts over Europe. Using\nthe Anemoi framework, models of both types are built by minimally adapting a\nshared architecture and trained using global and regional reanalyses in a\nnear-identical setup. Several inference experiments have been conducted to\nexplore their relative performance and highlight key differences. Results show\nthat both LAM and SGM are competitive deterministic MLWP models with generally\naccurate and comparable forecasting performance over the regional domain.\nVarious differences were identified in the performance of the models across\napplications. LAM is able to successfully exploit high-quality boundary\nforcings to make predictions within the regional domain and is suitable in\ncontexts where global data is difficult to acquire. SGM is fully self-contained\nfor easier operationalisation, can take advantage of more training data and\nsignificantly surpasses LAM in terms of (temporal) generalisability.

The interpretation of the\nhelioseismic data is however complicated by the non-trivial relationship\nbetween helioseismic observables and the physical perturbations associated with\nacoustic modes, as well as by various instrumental effects. Aims: We aim to\nimprove our understanding of the signature of acoustic modes measured in the\nHelioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) continuum intensity and Doppler velocity\nobservables by accounting for radiative transfer, solar background rotation,\nand spacecraft velocity. Methods: We start with a background model atmosphere\nthat accurately reproduces solar limb darkening and the Fe I 6173{\\AA} spectral\nline profile. We employ first-order perturbation theory to model the effect of\nacoustic oscillations on inferred intensity and velocity. By solving the\nradiative transfer equation in the atmosphere, we synthesize the spectral line,\nconvolve it with the six HMI spectral windows, and deduce continuum intensity\n(hmi.Ic_45s) and Doppler velocity (hmi.V_45s) according to the HMI algorithm.\nResults: We analytically derive the relationship between mode displacement in\nthe atmosphere and the HMI observables, and show that both intensity and\nvelocity deviate significantly from simple approximations. Specifically, the\ncontinuum intensity does not simply reflect the true continuum value, while the\nline-of-sight velocity does not correspond to a straightforward projection of\nthe velocity at a fixed height in the atmosphere. Our results indicate that\nthese deviations are substantial, with amplitudes of approximately 10% and\nphase shifts of around 10 degrees across the detector for both observables.\nMoreover, these effects are highly dependent on the acoustic mode under\nconsideration and the position on the solar disk.",

The area is roughly centered on \"Point Nemo\", the oceanic pole of inaccessibility, the location farthest from any land.\nThe defunct space station Mir and six Salyut stations are among those that have been ditched there. Other spacecraft that have been routinely scuttled in the region include various cargo spacecraft to the International Space Station, including Russian Progress cargo craft, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency H-II Transfer Vehicle, and the European Space Agency's Automated Transfer Vehicle.

The Outer Space Treaty produced by the United Nations reflects on damages caused by spacecraft on opposing nations. The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea reflects on general marine pollution. In rare cases, marine pollution could be caused by spillage of the highly toxic rocket propellant hydrazine.

The first activity epoch was discovered during the\nperihelion in 2016 (Garcia-Migani & Gil-Hutton 2018), so we were motivated to\nobserve it for recurrent cometary activity near its next perihelion passage (UT\n2024 July 20). We obtained observations with the Lowell Discovery Telescope\n(LDT), the Astrophysical Research Consortium (ARC) telescope, and the Vatican\nAdvanced Technology Telescope (VATT) and identified a second activity epoch\nwhen 362P had a true anomaly (v) as early as 318.1 deg. We conducted archival\nsearches of numerous repositories and identified images obtained with\nCanada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) MegaCam, Dark Energy Camera (DECam),\nPan-STARRS 1, SkyMapper, Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), and Las Cumbres\nObservatory Global Telescope (LCOGT) network data. Using these data, we\nidentified activity from a previously unreported timespan, and we did not\ndetect activity when 362P was away from perihelion, specifically 83 deg < v <\n318 deg. Detection of activity near perihelion and absence of activity away\nfrom perihelion suggest thermally-driven activity and volatile sublimation. Our\ndynamical simulations suggest 362P is a QHC and it will remain in a combined\nJupiter-family comet (JFC) and quasi-Hilda orbit over the next 1 kyr, though it\nwill become increasingly chaotic nearing the end of this timeframe. Our\nbackward simulations suggest 362P may have migrated from the orbit of a Long\nPeriod Comet (~53%) or Centaur (~32%), otherwise it remained a JFC (~15%) over\nthe previous 100 kyr. We recommend additional telescope observations from the\ncommunity as 362P continues outbound from its perihelion on UT 2024 July 20, as\nwell as continued observations for a third activity epoch.",

      "content": "Understanding galaxy classification depends on our interpretation of their\nspectra. To date, the hydrogen Balmer lines remain the most consistent way to\nclassify galaxies, but at 'intermediate' redshifts ($1.5 < z < 2.5$), galaxies\nare hard to parse in the BPT diagram (and its siblings) because the crucial\nH$\\alpha$ emission line is out of range of ground-based optical spectographs.\nIn this work, we re-explore a known diagram, which we call the OB-I diagram,\nthat compares the equivalent width of H$\\beta$ with the emission line ratio of\n[OIII]$\\lambda$5007/H$\\beta$, and breathe new life into it, as it has the\npotential to 'illuminate the fog' that permeates galaxy classification in the\nrestframe optical spectra. Using data from SDSS, LEGA-C, VANDELS, JADES, 3D-HST\nand MOSDEF, we explore galaxy classification in the OB-I diagram at a wide\nrange of redshifts ($0 < z < 2.7$). We find that, at $z < 0.4$, the OB-I\ndiagram clearly separates galaxies between two distinct types, which we divide\nwith an empirical fit: one dominated by AGN and a second made up of a mixed\npopulation of SF galaxies and AGN activity. This mixed population can be\npartially separated from a pure SF population, with a simple semi-empirical fit\nderived from a comparison with theoretical models and the BPT diagrams. At\nhigher redshifts, we find that the majority of AGNs identified by other\nclassification schemes are correctly recovered by the OB-I diagram, potentially\nmaking this diagram resistant to the 'cosmic shift' that plagues most optical\nclassification schemes. Overall, the OB-I diagram, which only requires two\nemission lines to be implemented, is a useful tool at separating galaxies that\npossess a dominating AGN component in their emission from others, from the\nLocal Universe ($z < 0.1$) to the Cosmic Noon ($z \\sim 2$), without any need\nfor significant adjustments in our empirical fit.",

In remote sensing literature, the volume of pile is\nestimated by relying on the illumination property of object to construct the\ngeometric shape from a single image, alternatively, stereographic imaging for\nconstruction of a digital elevation model from pairs of images. In a fresh\nperspective, we propose a novel approach for estimating volume from a single\noptical image in this work where we use the material property, which relates\nthe base dimensions of the pile to its height through the critical angle of\nrepose. In materials literature, often this is well-studied for fixed base and\ntheir \\textit{in situ} volume estimation for different materials. In this work,\nhowever, we mathematically model the geometric shape of the pile through a\nfixed height model. This is appropriate because the unloading crane arm that\nforms the pile can rise only up to a certain height and generally moved in the\nhorizontal plane during unloading of the material. After mathematically\nmodelling the geometric shape of regular piles for fixed heights under\nrectilinear motion of unloader, we provide closed form formula to estimate\ntheir volume. Apart from laying the mathematical foundations, we also test it\non real optical remote sensing data of an open bulk cargo storage facility for\nsilica sand and present the results. We obtain an accuracy of $95\\%$ in\nestimating the total bulk storage volume of the storage facility.

We consider eight test cases spanning: two regimes, eddy and\nanisotropic-jet turbulence; two Reynolds numbers, 10^3 and 10^4; and two\nobservation types, 4x coarse-resolution fields and coarse, sparse and gappy\nobservations. Our comprehensive skill metrics include norms of the\nreconstructed vorticity fields, turbulence statistical quantities, and\nquantification of the super-resolved probabilistic ensembles and their errors.\nWe also study the sensitivity to tuning parameters such as guidance strength.\nResults show that SDEdit generates unphysical fields, while DPS generates\nreasonable reconstructions at low computational cost but with smoothed\nfine-scale features. Both conditional approaches require re-training, but they\nreconstruct missing fine-scale features, are cycle-consistent with\nobservations, and possess the correct statistics such as energy spectra.\nFurther, their mean model errors are highly correlated with and predictable\nfrom their ensemble standard deviations. Results highlight the trade-offs\nbetween ease of implementation, fidelity (sharpness), and cycle-consistency of\nthe diffusion models, and offer practical guidance for deployment in\ngeophysical inverse problems.",

      "content": "The evolution of the supermassive Black Hole (BH) population across cosmic\ntimes remains a central unresolved issue in modern astrophysics, due to the\nmany noticeable uncertainties in the involved physical processes. Here we\ntackle the problem via a semi-empirical approach with minimal assumptions and\ndata-driven inputs. This is firmly grounded on a continuity plus Smoluchowski\nequation framework that allows to unitarily describe the two primary modes of\nBH growth: gas accretion and binary mergers. Key quantities related to the\nlatter processes are incorporated through educated parameterizations, and then\nconstrained in a Bayesian setup from joint observational estimates of the local\nBH mass function, of the large-scale BH clustering, and of the nano-Hz\nstochastic gravitational wave (GW) background measured from Pulsar Timimg Array\n(PTA) experiments. We find that the BH accretion-related parameters are\nstrongly dependent on the local BH mass function determination: higher\nnormalizations and flatter high-mass slopes in the latter imply lower radiative\nefficiencies and mean Eddington ratios with a stronger redshift evolution.\nAdditionally, the binary BH merger rate is estimated to be a fraction $\\lesssim\n10^{-1}$ of the galaxy merger rate derived from galaxy pairs counts by JWST,\nand constrained not to exceed the latter at $\\gtrsim 2\\sigma$. Relatedly, we\nhighlight hints of a possible tension between current constraints on BH\ndemographics and the interpretation of the nano-Hz GW background as\npredominantly caused by binary BH mergers. Specifically, we bound the latter's\ncontribution to $\\lesssim 30-50\\%$ at $\\sim 3\\sigma$, suggesting that either\nsystematics in the datasets considered here have been underestimated so far, or\nthat additional astrophysical/cosmological sources are needed to explain the\nresidual part of the signal measured by PTA experiments.",

Linear calculations found that the unstratified monodisperse DSI has\ngrowth rates much higher than the SI even with lower initial dust to gas\nratios. However, recent nonlinear investigation found no evidence of strong\ndust clumping at the saturation level. Aims. To investigate the nonlinear\nsaturation of the mono- and polydisperse DSI. We examine the convergence\nbehaviour wrt. both the numerical resolution and the number of species. By\ncharacterising the morphology of the dust evolution triggered by the DSI, we\ncan shed more light on its role in planetesimal formation. Methods. We perform\na suite of 2D shearing box hydro simulations with the code Idefix, both in the\nmono- and polydisperse regimes. We focus on the time evolution of the maximum\ndust density, noting the time at which the instability is triggered, as well as\nanalyse the morphology of the resultant structure. Results. In our monodisperse\nsimulations, the maximum dust density increases and the instability saturates\nearlier with higher spatial resolution, with no signs of convergence. The\npolydisperse simulations do seem to converge with the number of species and\nproduce maximum dust densities that are comparable to, albeit lower than, the\nmonodisperse simulations. Different dust species tend to form adjacent but\nseparate dust filaments, which may have implications on dust growth and further\nclumping. Conclusions. The monodisperse DSI produces dust structure at\ndensities high enough that likely leads to clumping. The polydisperse DSI\nproduces lower but comparable dust densities. Our idealised treatment suggests\nthat the DSI is important for planetesimal formation, as it suffers less than\nthe SI from including a dust size distribution.",

We compare the emission of HCN(1-0), HNC(1-0) and HCO+(1-0) with the\nemission of N2H+(1-0) at cloud-scales (125 pc) across the central 5x7 kpc of\nthe Whirlpool galaxy, M51a, from \"Surveying the Whirlpool galaxy at Arcseconds\nwith NOEMA\" (SWAN). We find that the integrated intensities of HCN, HNC and\nHCO+ are more steeply correlated with N2H+ emission compared to the bulk\nmolecular gas tracer CO, and we find variations in this relation across the\ncenter, molecular ring, northern and southern disk of M51. Compared to HCN and\nHNC emission, the HCO+ emission follows the N2H+ emission more similarly across\nthe environments and physical conditions such as surface densities of molecular\ngas, stellar mass, star-formation rate, dynamical equilibrium pressure and\nradius. Under the assumption that N2H+ is a fair tracer of dense gas at these\nscales, this makes HCO+ a more favorable dense gas tracer than HCN within the\ninner disk of M51. In all environments within our field of view, even when\nremoving the central 2 kpc, HCN/CO, commonly used to trace average cloud\ndensity, is only weakly depending on molecular gas mass surface density. While\nratios of other dense gas lines to CO show a steeper dependency on the surface\ndensity of molecular gas, it is still shallow in comparison to other nearby\nstar-forming disk galaxies. The reasons might be physical conditions in M51\nthat are different from other normal star-forming galaxies. Increased\nionization rates, increased dynamical equilibrium pressure in the central few\nkpc and the impact of the dwarf companion galaxy NGC 5195 are proposed\nmechanisms that might enhance HCN and HNC emission over HCO+ and N2H+ emission\nat larger-scale environments and cloud scales.",

In\nthe line of research implied by the former possibility, in this work we shall\nexamine the implied neutron star phenomenology from vector $f(R)$ gravity\ninflationary models.

The\ncombination of complementary probes in terms of parameter degeneracies and\nsystematics is key to achieving these ambitious scientific goals. In this\ncontext, determining the optimal survey configuration for an analysis that\ncombines galaxy clustering, weak lensing, and galaxy-galaxy lensing, the\nso-called 3x2pt analysis, remains an open problem. In this paper, we present an\nefficient and flexible end-to-end pipeline to optimise the sample selection for\n3x2pt analyses in an automated way. Our pipeline is articulated in two main\nsteps: we first consider a self-organising map to determine the photometric\nredshifts of a simulated galaxy sample. As a proof of method for stage-IV\nsurveys, we use samples from the DESC Data Challenge 2 catalogue. This allows\nus to classify galaxies into tomographic bins based on their colour phenotype\nclustering. We then explore different redshift-bin edge configurations for weak\nlensing only as well as 3x2pt analyses in a novel way. Our method explores\nmultiple configurations of perturbed redshift-bin edges with respect to the\nfiducial case in an iterative manner. In particular, we sample tomographic\nconfigurations for the source and lens galaxies separately. We show that, using\nthis method we quickly converge into an optimised configuration for different\nnumbers of redshift bins and cosmologies. Our analysis demonstrates that for\nstage-IV surveys an optimal tomographic sample selection can increase the\nfigure of merit of the dark energy (DE) equation of state by a factor of\n$\\sim$2, comparable to an effective increase in survey area of $\\sim$4 for\nnon-optimal photometric survey analyses.",

It arrives at the perception that\nmass loss finds its origin in the gravity which makes the star a star in the\nfirst place, and is a mechanism for the star to equilibrate. This is\ncorroborated by a careful examination of various popular historical and recent\nempirical mass-loss rate prescriptions and theoretical works, and which\nprovides no evidence for an explicit dependence of red supergiant mass loss on\nmetallicity though dust-associated mass loss becomes less prevalent at lower\nmetallicity. It also identifies a common problem in methods that use tracers of\nmass loss, which do not correct for varying scaling factors (often because\nthere is no information available on which to base such correction) and as a\nresult tend to underestimate mass-loss rates at the lower end. Conversely,\ndense, extended chromospheres in themselves do not translate into high\nmass-loss rates, and the significance of stochastic mass loss can be\noverstated. On a population scale, on the other hand, binary interaction acts\nas a stochastic agent of mass loss of great import. In all, evidence is\noverwhelming that points at red supergiants at the lower mass end losing mass\nat insufficient rates to shed their mantles before core collapse, but massive\n(at birth) red supergiants to be prone to intense, dusty mass loss which sees\nthem become hotter stars before meeting their fate. This is consistent with the\nidentified progenitors of hydrogen-rich supernovae. Supernova evolution holds\ngreat promise to probe the mass loss but we caution against confusing\natmospheres with winds. Finally, promising avenues are looked into, which could\nforge step-change progress in what has been a long and arduous search for the\nholy grail of red supergiant mass loss. We may yet find it!",

The RTM-GD can ensure analytically smooth gradients,\nand thus significantly enhance gradient continuity, numerical stability, and\ncomputational efficiency in Hamiltonian-based ray tracing. To systematically\nevaluate the applicability and performance of RTM-GD, we propose a four-stage\nexperimental design.

Second, we perform an\nelevation-angle scanning experiment ranging from 3 to 65 degrees within a\nmid-latitude ionospheric environment.

Third, we further conduct\nsimulation experiments for high-elevation F2-mode propagation near the critical\nincident angle.

We identify\nVPOS member galaxies and integrate their orbits over the past 5 Gyr using time\nevolving gravitational potentials that account for the mutual interaction\nbetween the MW and the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). The reconstructed\ntrajectories allow us to examine the long-term evolution of the VPOS. We\nidentify 15 galaxies as members of the VPOS, including 9 MW and 6 LMC\nsatellites. We find that the VPOS has remained a stable structure, maintaining\na roughly constant thickness ($\\sim$ 15 kpc), flattening ($c/a \\sim$ 0.2), and\norientation over time. The VPOS is not a transient alignment, but a long-lived\nplanar structure in the MW system, that has persisted for at least the last 5\nGyrs and predates the recent LMC infall. While the LMC exerts a strong\ngravitational influence on the MW satellites, its impact on the VPOS is\nlimited, leading only to mild perturbations. The structural properties of the\nVPOS remain almost unchanged, whether or not LMC satellites are included in the\nanalysis, indicating a smooth dynamical integration with the rest of VPOS\nmembers upon entering the MW virial radius. This minimal dynamical impact on\nthe VPOS results from the remarkable alignment between the LMC's orbit and the\nplane's orientation. We conclude that the VPOS is a stable, long-lived\nstructure that predates the recent infall of the LMC and retains nearly\nconstant structural properties over the last 5 Gyrs. Our findings suggest a\nstrong connection between the VPOS and the LMC, consistent with a scenario in\nwhich the LMC is on its second pericentre and the VPOS originated primarily\nfrom satellites stripped during the first passage.",

      "content": "Understanding Titan's planetary boundary layer (PBL) -- the lowest region of\nthe atmosphere influenced by surface conditions -- remains challenging due to\nTitan's thick atmosphere and limited observations. Previous modeling studies\nhave also produced inconsistent estimates of surface temperature, a critical\ndeterminant of PBL behavior, often without clear explanations grounded in\nsurface energy balance. In this study, we develop a theoretical framework and\napply a three-dimensional dry general circulation model (GCM) to investigate\nhow surface thermal inertia influences surface energy balance and temperature\nvariability across diurnal and seasonal timescales. At diurnal timescales,\nlower thermal inertia surfaces exhibit larger temperature swings and enhanced\nsensible heat fluxes due to inefficient subsurface heat conduction. In\ncontrast, at seasonal timescales, surface temperature variations show weak\nsensitivity to thermal inertia, as atmospheric damping tends to dominate over\nsubsurface conduction. The PBL depth ranges from a few hundred meters to 1,000\nm on diurnal timescales, while seasonal maxima reach 2,000--3,000 m, supporting\nthe interpretation from a previous study that the Huygens probe captured the\ntwo PBL structures. Simulated seasonal winds at the Huygens landing site\nsuccessfully reproduce key observed features, including near-surface retrograde\nwinds and meridional wind reversals within the lowest few kilometers,\nconsistent with Titan's cross-equatorial Hadley circulation. Simulations at the\nplanned Dragonfly landing site predict shallower thermal PBLs with broadly\nsimilar wind patterns. This work establishes a physically grounded framework\nfor understanding Titan's surface temperature and boundary layer variability,\nand offers a unified explanation of Titan's PBL behavior that provides improved\nguidance for future missions.",

The Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System (IRNSS) will follow and Japan's Quasi-Zenith Satellite System (QZSS) scheduled for 2023 will augment the accuracy of a number of GNSS. \nA satellite navigation device can retrieve location and time information from one or more GNSS systems in all weather conditions, anywhere on or near the Earth's surface. Satnav reception requires an unobstructed line of sight to four or more GNSS satellites, and is subject to poor satellite signal conditions. In exceptionally poor signal conditions, for example in urban areas, satellite signals may exhibit multipath propagation where signals bounce off structures, or are weakened by meteorological conditions. Obstructed lines of sight may arise from a tree canopy or inside a structure, such as in a building, garage or tunnel. Today, most standalone Satnav receivers are used in automobiles. The Satnav capability of smartphones may use assisted GNSS (A-GNSS) technology, which can use the base station or cell towers to provide a faster Time to First Fix (TTFF), especially when satellite signals are poor or unavailable. However, the mobile network part of the A-GNSS technology would not be available when the smartphone is outside the range of the mobile reception network, while the satnav aspect would otherwise continue to be available.",

The first (and so far only) SLS launch was the uncrewed Artemis I, which took place on 16 November 2022.\nDevelopment of SLS began in 2011 as a replacement for the retiring Space Shuttle as well as the canceled Ares I and Ares V launch vehicles. SLS was built using existing Shuttle technology, including solid rocket boosters and RS-25 engines. The rocket has been criticized for its political motivations, seen as a way to preserve jobs and contracts for aerospace companies involved in the Shuttle program at great expense to NASA. The project has faced significant challenges, including mismanagement, substantial budget overruns, and significant delays. The first Congressionally mandated launch in late 2016 was delayed by nearly six years.\nAll Space Launch System flights are to be launched from Launch Complex 39B at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The first three SLS flights are expected to use the Block 1 configuration, comprising a core stage, extended Space Shuttle boosters developed for Ares I and the Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage (ICPS) upper stage. The improved Block 1B configuration, with the powerful and purpose-built Exploration Upper Stage (EUS), is planned to be introduced on the fourth flight; a further improved Block 2 configuration with new solid rocket boosters is planned for the ninth flight. After the launch of Artemis IV, NASA plans to transfer production and launch operations of SLS to Deep Space Transport LLC, a joint venture between Boeing and Northrop Grumman.

In this study, we quantitatively investigate this\nphenomenon within the framework of Ohmic dissipation arising from magnetic\ninduction in the atmosphere, one of the most promising mechanisms for\nexplaining the radius anomaly. We simulate the evolution of irradiated giant\nplanets with MESA, spanning the observed range of masses and equilibrium\ntemperatures, incorporating an internal source of Ohmic dissipation that\nextends to deep layers of the envelope. We infer average atmospheric wind\nintensities, averaged in the region $p < 10$ bar, in the range 0.01-1 km/s in\norder to reproduce the range of observed radii, decreasing roughly linearly\nwith planetary mass, and much more steeply with equilibrium temperature. This\nis consistent with the expected effects of magnetic drag from the induced\nfield, which is higher for more intense irradiation, via conductivity, and for\nlarger masses, which have higher dynamo fields. Due to the evolution of the\ndynamo field and the proportionality of the induced currents on it, the Ohmic\nefficiency typically decreases by at least one order of magnitude from 0.1 to\n10 Gyr, at contrast with the common assumption of a constant-in-time value.\nNotably, the extent of the main convective region, and the associated heat flux\nsupporting the dynamo, is reduced in the presence of strong Ohmic dissipation,\nwhich in turn depends on the dynamo field strength, generating a non-trivial\ncoupling of the latter with the atmospheric induction, potentially leading to\nan oscillatory behaviour of the field strength. These findings remain generally\nvalid even when accounting for a long-term increase in the main-sequence host\nstar luminosity, although this case can more readily lead to HJ re-inflation,\nconsistent with previous studies.",

Recently, our multizone method has successfully achieved global\ndynamical steady-states of hot accretion flows in three-dimensional general\nrelativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations by tracking the\nbidirectional interaction between a non-spinning BH and its host galaxy. In\nthis paper, we present technical improvements to the method and apply it to\nspin $a_*=0.9$ BHs, which power relativistic jets. We first test the new\nmultizone set-up with a smaller Bondi radius, $R_B\\approx400\\,r_g$, where $r_g$\nis the gravitational radius. The strongly magnetized accretion launches a\nrelativistic jet with an intermediate feedback efficiency $\\eta\\sim30\\,\\%$, in\nbetween that of a prograde ($\\eta\\sim100\\,\\%$) and retrograde ($\\eta\\sim\n10\\,\\%$) torus. Interestingly, both prograde and retrograde simulations also\neventually converge to the same intermediate efficiency when evolved long\nenough, as accumulated magnetic fields remove gas rotation. We then extend\nstrongly magnetized simulations to larger Bondi radii, $R_B\\approx\n2\\times10^3,~2\\times 10^4,~2\\times 10^5\\,r_g$. We find that the BH accretion\nrate $\\dot{M}$ is suppressed with respect to the Bondi rate $\\dot{M}_B$ as\n$\\dot{M}/\\dot{M}_B\\propto R_B^{-1/2}$. However, despite some variability, the\ntime-averaged feedback efficiency is $\\eta\\sim30\\,\\%$, independent of $R_B$.\nThis suggests that BH feedback efficiency in hot accretion flows is mainly\ngoverned by the BH spin ($a_*$) rather than by the galactic properties ($R_B$).\nFrom these first-principles simulations, we provide a feedback subgrid\nprescription for cosmological simulations: $\\dot{E}_{\\rm\nfb}=2\\times10^{-3}[R_B/(2\\times10^5\\,r_g)]^{-1/2}\\dot{M}_Bc^2$ for BH spin\n$a_*=0.9$.",

      "content": "Planetary science (or more rarely, planetology) is the scientific study of planets (including Earth), celestial bodies (such as moons, asteroids, comets) and planetary systems (in particular those of the Solar System) and the processes of their formation. It studies objects ranging in size from micrometeoroids to gas giants, with the aim of determining their composition, dynamics, formation, interrelations and history. It is a strongly interdisciplinary field, which originally grew from astronomy and Earth science, and now incorporates many disciplines, including planetary geology, cosmochemistry, atmospheric science, physics, oceanography, hydrology, theoretical planetary science, glaciology, and exoplanetology. Allied disciplines include space physics, when concerned with the effects of the Sun on the bodies of the Solar System, and astrobiology.\nThere are interrelated observational and theoretical branches of planetary science. Observational research can involve combinations of space exploration, predominantly with robotic spacecraft missions using remote sensing, and comparative, experimental work in Earth-based laboratories. The theoretical component involves considerable computer simulation and mathematical modelling.\nPlanetary scientists are generally located in the astronomy and physics or Earth sciences departments of universities or research centres, though there are several purely planetary science institutes worldwide. Generally, planetary scientists study one of the Earth sciences, astronomy, astrophysics, geophysics, or physics at the graduate level and concentrate their research in planetary science disciplines. There are several major conferences each year, and a wide range of peer reviewed journals. Some planetary scientists work at private research centres and often initiate partnership research tasks.",

Introduced as the flagship sub-model of the Mercury Marquis in 1975, the Grand Marquis became a stand-alone model line in 1983, serving as the largest Mercury sedan. The model line served as the sedan counterpart of the Mercury Colony Park station wagon up to 1991. The fourth generation was the basis of the 2003 and 2004 Mercury Marauder.\nFrom 1979 until 2011, the Grand Marquis shared the rear-wheel drive (RWD) Panther platform with the Ford LTD Crown Victoria (Ford Crown Victoria after 1992), and from 1980, the Lincoln Town Car. For over three decades, the Ford and Mercury sedans were functionally identical, with two of the three generations of the model line sharing the same roofline. The Grand Marquis was available as a four-door sedan for nearly its entire run; from 1988 to its final year in 2011, it was the only body style that was offered. A four-door hardtop was available from 1975 to 1978 and a two-door hardtop coupe from 1975 to 1987.\nThe Grand Marquis was the second-best-selling Mercury line (after the Cougar) with 2.7 million units produced; at 36 years of continuous production, the Grand Marquis was the longest-running Mercury nameplate (the Cougar, 34 years). Ford manufactured the Grand Marquis, alongside the Mercury Marquis, Mercury Marauder, Ford (LTD) Crown Victoria, and (beginning in 2007) the Lincoln Town Car, at two facilities: the St. Louis Assembly Plant in Hazelwood, Missouri (1979–1985) and the St. Thomas Assembly Plant in Southwold, Ontario, Canada (1986–2011). \nFord announced the discontinuation of the Mercury brand in 2010, but a few 2011 model-year Mercurys were made. The last Grand Marquis - and the final Mercury branded car - was produced on January 4, 2011, at St. Thomas Assembly.",

      "content": "The original Kerr theorem provides the foundation for Kerr-Schild\ntransformations by classifying all shear-free and geodesic null congruences in\nflat spacetime; the key ingredient of the Kerr-Schild ansatz. However, due to\nthe high level of degeneracy of the outcome it is often less practical than its\nsymmetric refinements, which may single out congruences leading to physically\nsignificant spacetimes by imposing relevant symmetries. An illustrative example\nis the stationary axisymmetric version of Kerr theorem which has been shown to\nlead directly and uniquely to the Kerr black hole in vacuum. In this work, we\npropose a new symmetric refinement of the Kerr theorem by boosting the\nstationary symmetry into its ultrarelativistic limit to achieve invariance\nunder null translations, while keeping axisymmetry. Under these assumptions,\nthe classification yields only two distinct congruences. The first congruence\nis covariantly constant and, through the Kerr-Schild ansatz, evidently yields\nan axisymmetric pp-wave. The vacuum axisymmetric profile of this pp-wave\ndisplays a logarithmic dependence on the polar radius, characteristic of the\nexterior gravitational field of the Bonnor light beam, and includes as a\nspecial case the Aichelburg-Sexl ultrarelativistic limit of the Schwarzschild\nblack hole. The Kerr-Schild transformation of the second congruence gives rise\nto a non-trivial vacuum solution recently reported in [Phys. Rev. D 112, 024020\n(2025)]. Using circularity and appropriately fixing the reparameterization\ninvariance of the orthogonal manifold to the Killing fields, we show that the\nlatter solution corresponds to the well-known Taub-NUT spacetime with planar\ntopology. These results emphasize how symmetry-based refinements of the Kerr\ntheorem constitute a powerful tool to constructing physically essential\nspacetimes.",

A comprehensive study of comets over a wide heliocentric distance\nrange helps us understand the physical processes driving their activity and\nreveals compositional differences across dynamical groups. C/2017 K2\n(PANSTARRS) is a Dynamically New Oort Cloud comet (DNC) that showed activity as\nfar as 23.75 au and displayed a CO-rich coma at 6.72 au, making it a key object\nto investigate pre- and post-perihelion behavior.\n  Aims. We aim to study the long-term activity evolution and chemical\ncomposition of C/2017 K2 using photometry and spectroscopy, from October 2017\n(r$_h$ = 15.18 au) pre-perihelion to April 2025 (r$_h$ = 8.46 au)\npost-perihelion.\n  Methods. Broad-band and narrow-band imaging from both TRAPPIST telescopes\nenabled us to produce an 8-year light curve, color analysis, and derivation of\nactivity slopes. Production rates of OH, NH, CN, C$_3$, and C$_2$ were computed\nusing a Haser model, along with the dust proxy A(0)f$\\rho$. High-resolution\nspectra from CRIRES$^+$ and UVES at three epochs (May - September 2022)\nprovided simultaneous observations of parent and daughter species as the comet\ncrossed the water sublimation zone.\n  Results. The light curve of C/2017 K2 shows a complex evolution with varying\nslopes and a brightness plateau around perihelion, indicating multiple active\nspecies. Coma colors remained constant, suggesting uniform dust properties and\nsimilarity to other active long-period comets. Gas production rates indicate a\ntypical C$_2$/CN composition with a high dust-to-gas ratio. Analysis of\nforbidden oxygen lines shows a transition from CO and CO$_2$-driven activity to\nwater-driven sublimation inside 3 au. Infrared spectra reveal C/2017 K2 as a\ntypical-to-enriched comet, with HCN identified as the main parent of CN, and\nC$_2$ likely originating from C$_2$H$_2$ rather than C$_2$H$_6$.",

These perturbations lead to an\nartificial fragmentation in the filamentary network of the Large Scale\nStructure, often referred to as \"beads-on-a-string.\" This issue is particularly\napparent in cosmologies with a suppression of the matter power spectrum at\nsmall spatial scales, such as warm dark matter models, where the perturbations\ninduced by the N-body discretisation dominate the cosmological power at the\nsuppressed scales. Initial conditions based on third-order Lagrangian\nperturbation theory, which allow for a late-starting redshift, have been shown\nto minimise numerical errors contributing to such artefacts. In this work, we\ninvestigate whether the additional use of a spatially adaptive softening for\ndark matter particles, based on the gravitational tidal field, can reduce the\nseverity of artificial fragmentation. Tidal adaptive softening significantly\nimproves force accuracy in idealised filamentary collapse simulations over a\nfixed softening approach. However, it does not substantially reduce spurious\nhaloes in cosmological simulations when paired with such optimised initial\nconditions. Nevertheless, tidal adaptive softening induces a shift in halo\nformation times in warm dark matter simulations compared to a fixed softening\ncounterpart, an effect not seen in cold dark matter simulations. Furthermore,\ninitialising the initial conditions at an earlier redshift generally results in\nz=0 haloes forming from Lagrangian volumes with lower average sphericity. This\nsphericity difference could impact post-processing algorithms identifying\nspurious objects based on Lagrangian volume morphology.

Our capability of discovering pulsations in ULXs is limited, among\nothers, by poor statistics. However, catalogues and archives of high-energy\nmissions contain information which can be used to identify new candidate\npulsating ULXs (PULXs). The goal of this research is to single out candidate\nPULXs among those ULXs which have not shown pulsations due to an unfavourable\ncombination of factors. We applied an AI approach to an updated database of\nULXs detected by XMM-Newton. We first used an unsupervised clustering algorithm\nto sort out sources with similar characteristics into two clusters. Then, the\nsample of known PULX observations has been used to set the separation threshold\nbetween the two clusters and to identify the one containing the new candidate\nPULXs.

      "content": "The Venus flytrap (Dionaea muscipula) is a carnivorous plant native to the temperate and subtropical wetlands of North Carolina and South Carolina, on the East Coast of the United States. Although various modern hybrids have been created in cultivation, D. muscipula is the only species of the monotypic genus Dionaea. It is closely related to the waterwheel plant (Aldrovanda vesiculosa) and the cosmopolitan sundews (Drosera), all of which belong to the family Droseraceae. Dionaea catches its prey—chiefly insects and arachnids—with a \"jaw\"-like clamping structure, which is formed by the terminal portion of each of the plant's leaves; when an insect makes contact with the open leaves, vibrations from the prey's movements ultimately trigger the \"jaws\" to shut via tiny hairs (called \"trigger hairs\" or \"sensitive hairs\") on their inner surfaces. Additionally, when an insect or spider touches one of these hairs, the trap prepares to close, only fully enclosing the prey if a second hair is contacted within (approximately) twenty seconds of the first contact. Triggers may occur as quickly as 1⁄10 of a second from initial contact.\nThe requirement of repeated, seemingly redundant triggering in this mechanism serves as a safeguard against energy loss and to avoid trapping objects with no nutritional value; the plant will only begin digestion after five more stimuli are activated, ensuring that it has caught a live prey animal worthy of consumption. These hairs also possess a heat sensor. A forest fire, for example, causes them to snap shut, making the plant more resilient to periods of summer fires.\nAlthough widely cultivated for sale, the population of the Venus flytrap has been rapidly declining in its native range. As of 2017, the species was under Endangered Species Act review by the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service.",

      "content": "The study of the atmosphere of ultra-hot Jupiters (UHJs) with equilibrium\ntemperature $\\geq$2000 K provides valuable insights into atmospheric physics\nunder such extreme conditions. We aim to characterise the dayside thermal\nspectrum of the UHJ WASP-76b and investigate its properties. We analysed data\ngathered with three high-resolution spectrographs, specifically two nights with\nsimultaneous observations of HARPS-N and GIANO-B, and four nights of publicly\navailable ESPRESSO optical spectra. We observed the planet's dayside covering\norbital phases between quadratures (0.25 < $\\phi$ < 0.75). We performed a\nhomogeneous analysis of the GIANO-B, HARPS-N and ESPRESSO data and co-added the\nsignal of thousands of planetary lines through cross-correlation with simulated\nspectra of the planetary atmosphere. We report the detection of CO in the\ndayside atmosphere of WASP-76b with a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of 10.4 in\nthe GIANO-B spectra. In addition, we detect Fe I in both the HARPS-N and\nESPRESSO datasets, with S/N of 3.5 and 6.2, respectively. A signal from Fe I is\nalso identified in one of the two GIANO-B observations, with a S/N of 4.0.\nInterestingly, a qualitatively similar pattern - with a weaker detection in one\nepoch compared to the other - is also observed in the two HARPS-N nights. The\nGIANO-B results are therefore consistent with those obtained with HARPS-N.\nFinally, we compared our strongest detections of CO (GIANO-B) and Fe I\n(ESPRESSO), with predictions from Global Circulation Models (GCMs). Both\ncross-correlation and likelihood analyses favour the GCM that includes\natmospheric dynamics over a static (no-dynamics) model when applied to the\nESPRESSO data. This study adds to the growing body of literature employing GCMs\nto interpret high-resolution spectroscopic measurements of exoplanet\natmospheres.",

      "content": "Searching for signs of life is a primary goal of the Habitable Worlds\nObservatory (HWO). However, merely detecting oxygen, methane, or other widely\ndiscussed biosignatures is insufficient evidence for a biosphere. In parallel\nwith biosignature detection, exoplanet life detection additionally requires\ncharacterization of the broader physicochemical context to evaluate planetary\nhabitability and the plausibility that life could produce a particular\nbiosignature in a given environment. Life detection further requires that we\ncan confidently rule out photochemical or geological phenomena that can mimic\nlife (i.e. \"false positives\"). Evaluating false positive scenarios may require\ndifferent observatory specifications than biosignature detection surveys. Here,\nwe explore the coronagraph requirements for assessing habitability and ruling\nout known false positive (and false negative) scenarios for oxygen and methane,\nthe two most widely discussed biosignatures for Earth-like exoplanets. We find\nthat broad wavelength coverage ranging from the near UV (0.26 $\\mu$m) and\nextending into the near infrared (1.7 $\\mu$m), is necessary for contextualizing\nbiosignatures with HWO. The short wavelength cutoff is driven by the need to\nidentify Proterozoic-like biospheres via O$_3$, whereas the long wavelength\ncutoff is driven by the need to contextualize O$_2$ and CH$_4$ biosignatures\nvia constraints on C-bearing atmospheric species. The ability to obtain spectra\nwith signal-to-noise ratios of 20-40 across this 0.26-1.7 $\\mu$m range\n(assuming R=7 UV, R=140 VIS, and R=70 NIR) is also required. Without\nsufficiently broad wavelength coverage, we risk being unprepared to interpret\nbiosignature detections and may ultimately be ill-equipped to confirm the\ndetection of an Earth-like biosphere, which is a driving motivation of HWO..",

Each detection includes probabilistic membership assignments for\nthe KiDS-DR4 galaxies within the magnitude range $15<r'<24$. Methods. Using the\nAdaptive Matched Identifier of Clustered Objects (AMICO) algorithm, we\nidentified 23965 clusters over an effective area of about 839 deg2 in the\nredshift range $0.1\\le z \\le0.9$, with a signal-to-noise ratio $S/N>3.5$. The\nsample is highly homogeneous across the entire survey thanks to the restrictive\ngalaxy selection criteria we adopted.

We introduced algorithmic enhancements to AMICO to mitigate\nborder effects among neighbor tiles. Quality flags are also provided for each\ncluster detection. The sample purity and completeness assessments have been\nestimated using the SinFoniA data driven approach, thus avoiding strong\nassumptions embedded in numerical simulations.

The\nstatistically controlled samples quantify how the reionization redshift\n(z_reion) correlates with halo mass, local overdensity, and present-day pair\nproperties. Even at fixed mass, haloes in denser regions ionize earlier, and\nincreasing the overdensity smoothing scale systematically suppresses\nsmall-scale structure, including local variations and environmental gradients\nin z_reion. Virgo-like clusters accelerate reionization in their surroundings\nout to ~5-10 cMpc, beyond which local overdensity again becomes the dominant\nfactor. Within LG pairs, reionization timing offsets reach up to ~150 Myr and\ncorrelate with present-day halo separation, reflecting sensitivity to\nlarge-scale structure rather than mass ratio in driving asynchronous\nreionization. The results support an extreme inside-out picture where clustered\nsources rapidly ionize their immediate neighborhoods, while lower-density\nregions self-ionize later and voids wait for external homogenization. These\nlinks between environment and reionization timing explain the influence of\nprotoclusters and help interpret fossil records in LG dwarfs around the Milky\nWay. For Milky Way analogues, we find a reionization redshift as early (late)\nas z_reion = 12.7^{+2.0}_{-1.7} (8.88^{+0.66}_{-0.70}) when considered on 125\nckpc (500 ckpc) scales, with LG analogues following an inside-out reionization\npicture.",

      "content": "The scope of this Ph.D thesis is to study the effects of the presence of a\nboundary from a Quantum Field Theoretical perspective, searching for new\nphysics and explanations of observed phenomena. In particular, thanks to the\nformal QFT setting, the issue of the existence of local, accelerated, edge\nmodes in Hall systems is analyzed and understood in terms of the\nbulk-to-boundary approach as related to a curved background in topological QFTs\nwith boundary. Within this formalism the induced metric on the boundary can be\nassociated to the ad hoc potential introduced in the phenomenological models in\norder to obtain such non-constant edge velocities. This also leads to the\nprediction of local modes for Topological Insulators, and Quantum Spin Hall\nsystems in general. The paradigm for which only topological QFTs have a\nphysical content on the boundary is broken, and also non-Topological Quantum\nField Theories such as fracton models and Linearized Gravity are shown to have\nnon-trivial boundary dynamics. Indeed due to the breaking of their defining\nsymmetry both models have a current algebra of the Kac-Moody type on the\nboundary. In the case of fractons this algebra is in a generalized form, which\nalso appears in some kinds of higher order Topological Insulators, a sign of a\npossible relation between these materials and edge states of fracton\nquasiparticles. Concerning the theory of Linearized Gravity, instead, the\nalgebra is a standard Kac-Moody one, whose presence was suspected, but never\nproved before. Physical results on the boundary range between condensed matter,\nelasticity and (massive) gravity models. A collateral result, which enrich this\nThesis, is the building of a new covariant QFT for fractons with a peculiar\ngauge structure. This new model better highlight the properties of these\nquasiparticles.",

Information on new NASA technology that may be useful to industry is available in periodical and website form in \"NASA Tech Briefs\", while successful examples of commercialization are reported annually in the NASA publication Spinoffs. The publication has documented more than 2,000 technologies over time.\nIn 1979, notable science fiction author Robert A. Heinlein helped bring awareness to the spin-offs when he was asked to appear before Congress after recovering from one of the earliest known vascular bypass operations to correct a blocked artery. In his testimony, reprinted in his 1980 book Expanded Universe, Heinlein claimed that four NASA spin-off technologies made the surgery possible, and that they were only a few from a long list of NASA spin-off technologies from space development.\nSince 1976, the NASA Technology Transfer Program has connected NASA resources to private industry, referring to the commercial products as spin-offs. Well-known products that NASA claims as spin-offs include memory foam (originally named temper foam), freeze-dried food, firefighting equipment, emergency \"space blankets\", DustBusters, cochlear implants, LZR Racer swimsuits, and CMOS image sensors. As of 2016, NASA has published over 2,000 other spin-offs in the fields of computer technology, environment and agriculture, health and medicine, public safety, transportation, recreation, and industrial productivity.

Building off of a previous\nproof-of-principle successfully demonstrating training set reduction on static\npre-labelled datasets, using the ADEPT framework, this strategy was applied\nagain to the plasma turbulent transport problem within tokamak fusion plasmas,\nspecifically the QuaLiKiz quasilinear electrostatic gyrokinetic turbulent\ntransport code. While QuaLiKiz provides relatively fast evaluations, this study\nspecifically targeted small datasets to serve as a proxy for more expensive\ncodes, such as CGYRO or GENE. The newly implemented algorithm uses the SNGP\narchitecture for the classification component of the problem and the BNN-NCP\narchitecture for the regression component, training models for all turbulent\nmodes (ITG, TEM, ETG) and all transport fluxes ($Q_e$, $Q_i$, $\\Gamma_e$,\n$\\Gamma_i$, and $\\Pi_i$) described by the general QuaLiKiz output. With 45\nactive learning iterations, moving from a small initial training set of\n$10^{2}$ to a final set of $10^{4}$, the resulting models reached a $F_1$\nclassification performance of ~0.8 and a $R^2$ regression performance of ~0.75\non an independent test set across all outputs. This extrapolates to reaching\nthe same performance and efficiency as the previous ADEPT pipeline, although on\na problem with 1 extra input dimension.

Aboard the submersible were Stockton Rush, the American chief executive officer of OceanGate; Paul-Henri Nargeolet, a French deep-sea explorer and Titanic expert; Hamish Harding, a British businessman; Shahzada Dawood, a Pakistani-British businessman; and Dawood's son, Suleman.\nCommunication between Titan and its mother ship, MV Polar Prince, was lost 1 hour and 33 minutes into the dive. Authorities were alerted when it failed to resurface at the scheduled time later that day. After the submersible had been missing for four days, a remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV) discovered a debris field containing parts of Titan, about 500 metres (1,600 ft) from the bow of the Titanic. The search area was informed by the United States Navy's (USN) sonar detection of an acoustic signature consistent with an implosion around the time communications with the submersible ceased, suggesting the pressure hull had imploded while Titan was descending, resulting in the instantaneous deaths of all five occupants.\nThe search and rescue operation was performed by an international team organized by the United States Coast Guard (USCG), USN, and Canadian Coast Guard. Support was provided by aircraft from the Royal Canadian Air Force and United States Air National Guard, a Royal Canadian Navy ship, as well as several commercial and research vessels and ROVs.\nNumerous industry experts had stated concerns about the safety of the vessel. OceanGate executives, including Rush, had not sought certification for Titan, arguing that excessive safety protocols and regulations hindered innovation.",

Following the second Commercial Resupply Services (CRS) launch, the initial version Falcon 9 v1.0 was retired from use and replaced by the v1.1 version.\nFalcon 9 v1.1 was a significant evolution from Falcon 9 v1.0, with 60 percent more thrust and weight. Its maiden flight carried out a demonstration mission with the CASSIOPE satellite on 29 September 2013, the sixth overall launch of any Falcon 9.\nBoth stages of the two-stage-to-orbit vehicle used liquid oxygen (LOX) and rocket-grade kerosene (RP-1) propellants. The Falcon 9 v1.1 could lift payloads of 13,150 kilograms (28,990 lb) to low Earth orbit, and 4,850 kilograms (10,690 lb) to geostationary transfer orbit, which places the Falcon 9 design in the medium-lift range of launch systems.\nBeginning in April 2014, the Dragon capsules were propelled by Falcon 9 v1.1 to deliver cargo to the International Space Station under the Commercial Resupply Services contract with NASA. This version was also intended to ferry astronauts to the ISS under a NASA Commercial Crew Development contract signed in September 2014. However, SpaceX ended up using the upgraded Falcon 9 Block 5 version instead for all Crew Dragon missions.\nFalcon 9 v1.1 was notable for pioneering the development of reusable rockets, whereby SpaceX gradually refined technologies for first-stage boostback, atmospheric re-entry, controlled descent and eventual propulsive landing. This last goal was achieved on the first flight of the successor variant Falcon 9 Full Thrust, after several near-successes with Falcon 9 v1.1.",

Currently, a scientific program is underway, sponsored by NASA's Office of Space Science in the United States, in collaboration with international partners France, Italy, and the European Space Agency. Plans exist for the continuation of this robotic program through the first automated return of Martian samples in 2014. Mars is also a prime long-term objective for human exploration, and within NASA, efforts are being made to provide the best integration of the robotic program and future human exploration missions. From the perspective of human exploration missions, it is important to understand the scientific objectives of human missions, in order to design the appropriate systems, tools, and operational capabilities to maximize science on those missions. In addition, data from the robotic missions can provide critical environmental data - surface morphology, materials composition, evaluations of potential toxicity of surface materials, radiation, electrical and other physical properties of the Martian environment, and assessments of the probability that humans would encounter Martian life forms. Understanding of the data needs can lead to the definition of experiments that can be done in the near-term that will make the design of human missions more effective. This workshop was convened to begin a dialog between the scientific community that is central to the robotic exploration mission program and a set of experts in systems and technologies that are critical to human exploration missions. The charge to the workshop was to develop an understanding of the types of scientific exploration that would be best suited to the human exploration missions and the capabilities and limitations of human explorers in undertaking science on those missions.",

Two prototypes were built, and both were launched from the ground.\nThe earliest prototype was Grasshopper. It was announced in 2011 and began low-altitude, low-velocity hover/landing testing in 2012. Grasshopper was 106 ft (32 m) tall and made eight successful test flights in 2012 and 2013 before being retired. A second prototype of Falcon 9 was the larger and more capable Falcon 9 Reusable Development Vehicle (F9R Dev, also known as F9R Dev1) based on the Falcon 9 v1.1 launch vehicle. It was tested at higher altitudes and was capable of much higher velocity but was never tested at high velocity.  The F9R Dev1 vehicle was built in 2013–2014 and made its first low-altitude flight test on 17 April 2014; it was lost during a three-engine test at the McGregor test site on 22 August 2014, which ended the low-velocity test program. Further expansion of the flight test envelope for the reusable rocket was moved to descending Falcon 9 boosters that had been used on orbital flight trajectories on commercial orbital flights of the Falcon 9.\nThe Grasshopper and F9R Dev tests were fundamental to the development of the reusable Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets, which require vertical landings of the near-empty Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy first-stage booster tanks and engine assemblies. The Grasshopper and the F9R Dev tests led into a series of high-altitude, high-speed controlled-descent tests of post-mission (spent) Falcon 9 booster stages that accompanied the commercial Falcon 9 missions since September 2013. The latter eventually resulted in the first successful booster landing on 21 December 2015.",

As one of  the founders of the discipline, James Keeler, said, astrophysics \"seeks to ascertain the nature of the heavenly bodies, rather than their positions or motions in space—what they are, rather than where they are\", which is studied in celestial mechanics.\nAmong the subjects studied are the Sun (solar physics), other stars, galaxies, extrasolar planets, the interstellar medium, and the cosmic microwave background. Emissions from these objects are examined across all parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, and the properties examined include luminosity, density, temperature, and chemical composition. Because astrophysics is a very broad subject, astrophysicists apply concepts and methods from many disciplines of physics, including classical mechanics, electromagnetism, statistical mechanics, thermodynamics, quantum mechanics, relativity, nuclear and particle physics, and atomic and molecular physics.\nIn practice, modern astronomical research often involves substantial work in the realms of theoretical and observational physics.

      "title": "Evolving Wormholes in a Cosmological Background",
      "content": "Wormholes are non-trivial topological structures that arise as exact\nsolutions to Einstein's field equations, theoretically connecting distinct\nregions of spacetime via a throat-like geometry. While static traversable\nwormholes necessarily require exotic matter that violates the classical energy\nconditions, subsequent studies have sought to minimize such violations by\nintroducing time-dependent geometries embedded within cosmological backgrounds.\nThis review provides a comprehensive survey of evolving wormhole solutions,\nemphasizing their formulation within both general relativity and alternative\ntheories of gravity. We explore key developments in the construction of\nnon-static wormhole spacetimes, including those conformally related to static\nsolutions, as well as dynamically evolving geometries influenced by scalar\nfields. Particular attention is given to the wormholes embedded into\nFriedmann-Lema\\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universes and de Sitter\nbackgrounds, where the interplay between the cosmic expansion and wormhole\ndynamics is analyzed. We also examine the role of modified gravity theories,\nespecially in hybrid metric-Palatini gravity, which enable the realization of\ntraversable wormholes supported by effective stress-energy tensors that do not\nviolate the null or weak energy conditions. By systematically analyzing a wide\nrange of time-dependent wormhole solutions, this review identifies the specific\ngeometric and physical conditions under which wormholes can evolve consistently\nwith the null and weak energy conditions. These findings clarify how such\nconfigurations can be naturally integrated into cosmological models governed by\ngeneral relativity or modified gravity, thereby contributing to a deeper\ntheoretical understanding of localized spacetime structures in an expanding\nuniverse.",

      "title": "Black hole cosmology",
      "content": "The black hole cosmology (also called Schwarzschild cosmology or black hole universe) is a cosmological model in which the observable universe is the interior of a black hole.  This model was originally proposed in 1972 by Raj Pathria, who compared the Schwarzschild metric with the closed Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric at the maximum scale factor.  Subsequent studies analyzed a universe in a black hole by matching the Schwarzschild metric outside the black hole with the de Sitter space inside the black hole, on the assumption that some limiting curvature exists, or with the Friedmann space.  The scenarios in which the universe is formed in the interior of a black hole might naturally solve the horizon problem and flatness problem in cosmology.\nNikodem Popławski proposed in 2010 the first physically grounded mechanism for every black hole to avoid a gravitational singularity during gravitational collapse, undergo a non-singular gravitational bounce, and consequently create a new, expanding universe on the other side of its event horizon.  This mechanism is based on general relativity with spin and torsion, also known as the Einstein–Cartan–Sciama–Kibble theory of gravity, proposed by Élie Cartan, Dennis Sciama, and Thomas Kibble.  The existence of torsion is required for general relativity to be consistent with the conservation of the total (orbital plus spin) angular momentum of a free particle satisfying the Dirac equation in curved spacetime.  \nFermions are the source of torsion, generating a repulsive spin-spin interaction, which prevents the formation of singularities.  Quantum particle production strengthens this interaction, naturally generating a finite period of exponential expansion, known as cosmic inflation.  A non-singular bounce also occurs for non-spherical black holes.",

      "content": "Evaporation is gaining increasing attention as a calibration and evaluation\nvariable in hydrologic studies that seek to improve the physical realism of\nhydrologic models and go beyond the long-established streamflow-only\ncalibration. However, this trend is not yet reflected in sensitivity analyses\naimed at determining the relevant parameters to calibrate, where streamflow has\ntraditionally played a leading role. On the basis of a Pareto optimization\napproach, we propose a framework to integrate the temporal dynamics of\nstreamflow and evaporation into the sensitivity analysis and calibration stages\nof the hydrologic modeling exercise, here referred to as Pareto-based\nsensitivity analysis and multiobjective calibration. The framework is\nsuccessfully applied to a case study using the Variable Infiltration Capacity\n(VIC) model in three catchments located in Spain as representative of the\ndifferent hydroclimatic conditions within the Iberian Peninsula. Several VIC\nvegetation parameters were identified as important to the performance estimates\nfor evaporation during sensitivity analysis, and therefore were suitable\ncandidates to improve the model representation of evaporative fluxes.\nSensitivities for the streamflow performance, in turn, were mostly driven by\nthe soil and routing parameters, with little contribution from the vegetation\nparameters. The multiobjective calibration experiments were carried out for the\nmost parsimonious parameterization after a comparative analysis of the\nperformance gains and losses for streamflow and evaporation, and yielded\noptimal adjustments for both hydrologic variables simultaneously. Results from\nthis study will help to develop a better understanding of the trade-offs\nresulting from the joint integration of streamflow and evaporation data into\nmodeling frameworks.",

Most often space stations have been research stations, but they have also served military or commercial uses, such as hosting space tourists.\nSpace stations have been hosting the only continuous presence of humans in space. The first space station was Salyut 1 (1971), hosting the first crew, of the ill-fated Soyuz 11. Consecutively space stations have been operated since Skylab (1973) and occupied since 1987 with the Salyut successor Mir. Uninterrupted human presence in orbital space through space stations have been sustained since the operational transition from the Mir to the International Space Station (ISS), with the latter's first occupation in 2000.\nCurrently there are two fully operational space stations – the ISS and China's Tiangong Space Station (TSS), which have been occupied since October 2000 with Expedition 1 and since June 2022 with Shenzhou 14. The highest number of people at the same time on one space station has been 13, first achieved with the eleven day docking to the ISS of the 127th Space Shuttle mission in 2009. The present record for most people on all space stations at the same time has been 17, first reached on May 30, 2023, with 11 people on the ISS and 6 on the TSS.\nSpace stations are often modular, featuring docking ports, through which they are built and maintained, allowing the joining or movement of modules and the docking of other spacecrafts for the exchange of people, supplies and tools.

The\nstars in a subcluster are evolved as if they are the fragmentation products of\na single isolated prestellar core from which most of the natal gas has already\nbeen dispersed, and there are no correlations between the stars' initial\npositions and velocities. Two parameters are particularly important: the number\nof stars in the subcluster, $N$, and the fraction of kinetic energy in ordered\nrotation, $\\alpha_{\\rm rot}$. Increasing $N$ has the effect of systematically\ndecreasing the semi-major axes of the tighter orbits, but has very little\neffect on the semi-major axes of the wider orbits. The main effect of\n$\\alpha_{\\rm rot}$ is to regulate the distribution of mutual orbital\ninclinations, with $\\alpha_{\\rm rot}\\!\\sim\\!0.5$ producing a distribution of\norbital inclinations for triple systems which is consistent with observed\nvalues.

In $SO(10)$ GUTs, the\nscalar fields can arise from irreps contributing to the Yukawa sector at the\nrenormalisable level, such as $10_{\\mathrm{H}}$, $120_{\\mathrm{H}}$, and\n$\\overline{126}_{\\mathrm{H}}$, or from $16_{\\mathrm{H}}$ in non-renormalisable\ninteractions. The direct implications of these scalars include the violation of\nbaryon and lepton number, enabling processes such as nucleon decays,\nneutron-antineutron oscillation, and potentially accounting for the observed\nbaryon asymmetry of the universe. We systematically analyse their couplings to\nSM fermions, identifying diquark and leptoquark interactions vertices involving\nall scalars residing in $10_{\\mathrm{H}}$, $120_{\\mathrm{H}}$,\n$\\overline{126}_{\\mathrm{H}}$, and $16_{\\mathrm{H}}$ and comprehensively assess\ntheir contributions to nucleon decay, neutron-antineutron oscillation, quark\nflavour violation, and baryogenesis.

Conventional GUTs rely on multiple scalar irreps to avoid\nunrealistic fermion mass relations; for example, minimal $SU(5)$ with\n$5_{\\mathrm{H}}$ predicts degenerate down-quark and charged-lepton masses. We\ndemonstrate that quantum corrections from heavy scalars in a minimally extended\n$SU(5)$ model can lift this degeneracy, thereby reducing the arbitrariness in\nthe scalar sector, which has been called as indirect impact.

In-space propulsion exclusively deals with propulsion systems used in the vacuum of space and should not be confused with space launch or atmospheric entry.\nSeveral methods of pragmatic spacecraft propulsion have been developed, each having its own drawbacks and advantages. Most satellites have simple reliable chemical thrusters (often monopropellant rockets) or resistojet rockets for orbital station-keeping, while a few use momentum wheels for attitude control. Russian and antecedent Soviet bloc satellites have used electric propulsion for decades, and newer Western geo-orbiting spacecraft are starting to use them for north–south station-keeping and orbit raising. Interplanetary vehicles mostly use chemical rockets as well, although a few have used electric propulsion such as ion thrusters and Hall-effect thrusters. Various technologies need to support everything from small satellites and robotic deep space exploration to space stations and human missions to Mars.\nHypothetical in-space propulsion technologies describe propulsion technologies that could meet future space science and exploration needs. These propulsion technologies are intended to provide effective exploration of the Solar System and may permit mission designers to plan missions to \"fly anytime, anywhere, and complete a host of science objectives at the destinations\" and with greater reliability and safety. With a wide range of possible missions and candidate propulsion technologies, the question of which technologies are \"best\" for future missions is a difficult one; expert opinion now holds that a portfolio of propulsion technologies should be developed to provide optimum solutions for a diverse set of missions and destinations.",

Each universe has a Captain Britain designated to protect its version of the British Isles. These protectors are collectively known as the Captain Britain Corps. This numerical notation was continued in the series Excalibur and other titles. Each universe of the Multiverse in Marvel also appears to be defended by a Sorcerer Supreme at nearly all times, appointed by the mystic trinity of Vishanti to defend the world against threats primarily magical in nature from within and beyond and bearing the Eye of Agamotto.\nLater on, many writers would use and reshape the Multiverse in titles such as Exiles, X-Men, and Ultimate Fantastic Four. New universes would also spin out of storylines involving time-traveling characters such as Rachel Summers, Cable, and Bishop, as their actions rendered their home times alternate timelines.\nThe multiverse also plays a role in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), with the central and main universe having originally been known as Earth-199999 in external media and Earth-616 in internal media. The concept was first introduced in Doctor Strange (2016) before becoming the focal point of the franchise in \"The Multiverse Saga\" (2021–present).

This article provides a historical review of the primary\nelements leading to that strategy, including the building of aviation radiation\nawareness and collaborative efforts by global aviation and radiological bodies\nthat established mitigation standards. The validation of an ALARA strategy was\naccomplished using two UAL 990 flights on B777 200 aircraft between San\nFrancisco and Paris.

One method\nis flying lower magnetic latitudes to gain more Earth magnetic field shielding\nand the other is flying lower altitudes to use atmosphere depth shielding. Both\nof these ALARA shielding methods are controllable in airline operations and air\ntraffic management and have now been validated with total dose measurements by\nARMAS. This study shows the effectiveness of the strategy to deviate flight\npaths to lower magnetic latitude routes and lower altitudes during major\ngeomagnetic storms.

      "content": "Observations of the lunar exosphere provide valuable insights into dynamic\nprocesses affecting the Moon, such as meteoroid bombardment. The Chamberlain\nmodel was employed to estimate the zenith column density and temperature of Na\natoms on August 13/14, 2009, after the peak of the Perseid meteor shower.\nAdditionally, the column density and temperature of Na atoms delivered to the\nlunar exosphere by gradual processes during the peak on August 12/13, 2009,\nwere estimated. Expected ratios of line-of-sight column densities of Na atoms\nat three observed altitudes on August 12/13, 2009, were obtained using the\nChamberlain model and Monte Carlo simulations. The heightened intensities of Na\nemission lines on August 12/13, 2009, are attributed to the onset of the third\nshort-term peak in Perseid activity predicted by celestial mechanics. The best\nagreement between observations and theoretical models was achieved with a\ntheoretical temperature of 3000 K for impact-produced Na atoms. This third peak\nof Perseids began between 23:29 and 23:41 UT on August 12, 2009, lasting\napproximately 83 minutes, with a mass flux attributed to the Perseids ranging\nbetween 1.6 x 10^-16 and 5 x 10^-16 g cm^-2 s^-1. Additionally, depletion of Li\ncontent compared to Na content in the lunar exosphere was detected. A model\npredicting Perseid meteoroid stream activity on the Moon was developed and\ncompared with spectral observations of the lunar exosphere. By modeling 25,000\nyears of comet 109P/Swift-Tuttle's orbits, 175 cometary trails likely to have\ngenerated meteoroids near Earth and the Moon during the Perseid 2009 meteor\nshower were identified.

      "title": "Mercury poisoning",
      "content": "Mercury poisoning is a type of metal poisoning due to exposure to mercury. Symptoms depend upon the type, dose, method, and duration of exposure. They may include muscle weakness, poor coordination, numbness in the hands and feet, skin rashes, anxiety, memory problems, trouble speaking, trouble hearing, or trouble seeing. High-level exposure to methylmercury is known as Minamata disease. Methylmercury exposure in children may result in acrodynia (pink disease) in which the skin becomes pink and peels. Long-term complications may include kidney problems and decreased intelligence. The effects of long-term low-dose exposure to methylmercury are unclear.\nForms of mercury exposure include metal, vapor, salt, and organic compound. Most exposure is from eating fish, amalgam-based dental fillings, or exposure at a workplace. In fish, those higher up in the food chain generally have higher levels of mercury, a process known as biomagnification. Less commonly, poisoning may occur as a method of attempted suicide. Human activities that release mercury into the environment include the burning of coal and mining of gold. Tests of the blood, urine, and hair for mercury are available but do not relate well to the amount in the body.\nPrevention includes eating a diet low in mercury, removing mercury from medical and other devices, proper disposal of mercury, and not mining further mercury. In those with acute poisoning from inorganic mercury salts, chelation with either dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) or dimercaptopropane sulfonate (DMPS) appears to improve outcomes if given within a few hours of exposure. Chelation for those with long-term exposure is of unclear benefit. In certain communities that survive on fishing, rates of mercury poisoning among children have been as high as 1.7 per 100.",

To characterize our targets, we performed a\nglobal comparative analysis. We first applied a semi-empirical approach. By\nrefining their age and bolometric luminosity, we derived key atmospheric and\nphysical properties, such as Teff, mass, surface gravity (g), and radius, using\nthe evolutionary model COND03. These results were then compared with the\nresults from a synthetic analysis based on three self-consistent atmospheric\nmodels. To compare our spectra with these grids we used the Bayesian inference\ncode ForMoSA. We found similar Lbol estimates between both approaches, but an\nunderestimated Teff from the cloudy models, likely due to a lack of absorbers\nthat could dominate the J and H bands of early L. We also observed a\ndiscrepancy in the log(g) estimates, which are dispersed between 3.5 and 5.5\ndex for mid-L objects. We interpreted this as a bias caused by a range of\nrotational velocities leading to cloud migration toward equatorial latitudes,\ncombined with a variety of viewing angles that result in different observed\natmospheric properties (cloud column densities, atmospheric pressures, etc.).\nFinally, while providing robust estimates of [M/H] and C/O for individual\nobjects remains challenging, the X-SHYNE library globally suggests solar\nvalues, which are consistent with a formation via stellar formation mechanisms.\nThis study highlights the strength of homogeneous datasets in performing\ncomparative analyses, reducing the impact of systematics, and ensuring robust\nconclusions while avoiding over-interpretation.",

It uses mathematics, physics, and chemistry in order to explain their origin and their overall evolution. Objects of interest include planets, moons, stars, nebulae, galaxies, meteoroids, asteroids, and comets. Relevant phenomena include supernova explosions, gamma ray bursts, quasars, blazars, pulsars, and cosmic microwave background radiation. More generally, astronomy studies everything that originates beyond Earth's atmosphere. Cosmology is a branch of astronomy that studies the universe as a whole.\nAstronomy is one of the oldest natural sciences. The early civilizations in recorded history made methodical observations of the night sky. These include the Egyptians, Babylonians, Greeks, Indians, Chinese, Maya, and many ancient indigenous peoples of the Americas. In the past, astronomy included disciplines as diverse as astrometry, celestial navigation, observational astronomy, and the making of calendars.\nProfessional astronomy is split into observational and theoretical branches. Observational astronomy is focused on acquiring data from observations of astronomical objects. This data is then analyzed using basic principles of physics. Theoretical astronomy is oriented toward the development of computer or analytical models to describe astronomical objects and phenomena. These two fields complement each other. Theoretical astronomy seeks to explain observational results and observations are used to confirm theoretical results.\nAstronomy is one of the few sciences in which amateurs play an active role. This is especially true for the discovery and observation of transient events. Amateur astronomers have helped with many important discoveries, such as finding new comets.",

It usually focuses on space closest to Earth, Low Earth Orbit (LEO), since this environment is the one most used and therefore most relevant to humans. It also considers Geostationary Equatorial Orbit (GEO) as this orbit is another popular choice for Earth-orbiting mission designs.\nThe issue of space sustainability is a new phenomenon that is gaining more attention in recent years as the launching of satellites and other space objects has increased. These launches have resulted in more space debris orbiting Earth, hindering the ability of nations to operate in the space environment while increasing the risk of a future launch-related accident that could disrupt its proper use. Space weather also acts as an outstanding factor for spacecraft failure. The current protocol for spacecraft disposal at end-of-life has, at large, not been followed in mission designs and demands extraneous amounts of time for disposal.\nPrecedent created through prior policy initiatives has facilitated initial mitigation of space pollution and created a foundation for space sustainability efforts. To further mitigation, international and transdisciplinary consortia have stepped forward to analyze existing operations, develop standards, and incentivize future procedures to prioritize a sustainable approach. A shift towards sustainable interactions with the space environment is growing in urgency due to the implications of climate change and increasing risk to spacecraft as time presses on.",

For observers, however, aerosols have been\na multi-decade migraine, as their chronic presence hides atmospheric features.\nFor hot Jupiters, the large day-night temperature contrast drives inhomogeneous\nthermal structures and aerosol distribution, leading to different limb\nproperties probed by transit spectra. We present JWST NIRISS/SOSS spectra of\nmorning and evening limbs for nine gas giants with equilibrium temperatures of\n~800-1700 K. By measuring feature size of the 1.4 $\\mu$m water band for both\nlimbs, we found three planets (WASP-39 b, WASP-94 Ab, and WASP-17 b) show\nprominent ($>$5$\\sigma$) limb-limb atmospheric opacity difference with muted\nmorning and clear evening limbs. The heavily muted water features on morning\nlimbs indicate high-altitude (0.1 to 0.01 mbar) aerosols. To simultaneously\nhave clear evening limbs requires processes with timescales ($\\sim$day)\ncomparable to advection to remove these lofted grains, and we found that both\ndownwelling flow and dayside cloud evaporation could be plausible mechanisms.\nWe hypothesize an empirical boundary--termed the \"asymmetry horizon\"--in\ntemperature-gravity space that marks the transition where inhomogeneous aerosol\ncoverage begins to emerge. Heterogeneous aerosol coverage is common among hot\nJupiters. If unrecognized, limb averaging suppresses spectral features,\nmimicking high-mean-molecular-weight atmospheres, inflating inferred\nmetallicity by up to 2 dex, and underestimating limb temperatures by as much as\nhalf.

We constrained the\nplanetary mass using spectroscopic data from CARMENES, an instrument that has\nalready played a major role in confirming the planetary nature of the transit\nsignal detected by TESS. We used Gaussian Processes (GP) to improve the\nanalysis because the host star has a relatively strong activity that affects\nthe radial velocity dataset. In addition, we applied a GP to the TESS light\ncurves to reduce the correlated noise in the detrended dataset. The stellar\nactivity indicators show a strong signal that is related to the stellar\nrotation period of $\\sim$ 32 days. This stellar activity signal was also\nconfirmed on the TESS light curves.

This detection\nincreases the sample of planets orbiting K-type stars. This sample is valuable\nfor investigating the valley of planets with small radii around this type of\nstar.

This study explores these\ncharacteristics across different regions of two distinct ICMEs observed at 1\nAU, utilizing in-situ measurements from the Wind spacecraft. The polytropic\nindices, Gamma_e for electrons and Gamma_p for protons) reveal significant\ndeviations from adiabatic expansion, suggesting sustained heating mechanisms\nwithin the ICMEs even at 1AU. The effective polytropic index (Gamma_eff) of the\nmagnetic ejecta (ME) in both ICME1 and ICME2 is found to be near-isothermal\n(Gamma_eff = 0.88 and 0.76), aligning with measurements near the Sun,\nhighlighting consistent heating across heliospheric distances. Spectral\nanalysis at the inertial scale reveals Kolmogorov-like turbulence in the fast\nICME1's ME, while the ME of the slower ICME2 exhibits less developed turbulence\nwith a shallower spectral index (alpha_B). The turbulence analysis in the\ndissipation scale indicates that the ME of slower ICME2 is less affected by the\nambient medium than the faster ICME2. The MEs of both ICMEs show magnetic\ncompressibility much smaller than unity (C_B < 1), suggesting dominant Alfvenic\nfluctuations in the MEs. Notably, the partial variance of increments (PVI)\nmethod identifies more intermittent structures, such as current sheets and\nreconnection sites, in the sheath and post-ICME regions. Higher PVI values\ncorrelate with regions of increased electron and proton temperature (for the\nsheath region), as well as higher C_B values, highlighting their role in local\nenergy dissipation. These results underscore the importance of ongoing heating\nand turbulence processes in shaping the evolution of ICMEs.",

The spacecraft used a gravity assist from Mars on March 1, 2025, and it will use a gravity assist from Earth on December 3, 2026, before arriving at Europa in April 2030. The spacecraft will then perform a series of flybys of Europa while orbiting Jupiter.\nEuropa Clipper is designed to study evidence for a subsurface ocean underneath Europa's ice crust, found by the Galileo spacecraft which orbited Jupiter from 1995 to 2003. Plans to send a spacecraft to Europa were conceived with projects such as Europa Orbiter and Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter, in which a spacecraft would be inserted into orbit around Europa. However, due to the effects of radiation from the magnetosphere of Jupiter in Europa orbit, it was decided that it would be safer to insert a spacecraft into an elliptical orbit around Jupiter and make 49 close flybys of the moon instead. The Europa Clipper spacecraft is larger than any previous spacecraft for NASA planetary missions.\nThe orbiter will analyze the induced magnetic field around Europa, and attempt to detect plumes of water ejecta from a subsurface ocean; in addition to various other tests.\nThe mission's name is a reference to the lightweight, fast clipper ships of the 19th century that routinely plied trade routes, since the spacecraft will pass by Europa at a rapid cadence, as frequently as every two weeks. The mission patch, which depicts a sailing ship, references the moniker.\nEuropa Clipper complements the ESA's Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer, launched in 2023, which will attempt to fly past Europa twice and Callisto multiple times before moving into orbit around Ganymede.",

The CMB is one of the few windows into the ionization\nstate of the IGM during reionization's first half, providing an important probe\nof the ionizing photon sources at those times. Meanwhile, measurements of the\nLyman-$\\alpha$ forest in the spectra of high-$z$ quasars have improved to the\nlevel of tightly constraining the timing of reionization's end. In this paper,\nwe use radiative transfer simulations to explore how measurements of the patchy\nkinetic Sunyaev Zel'dovich (pkSZ) effect, when combined with Lyman-$\\alpha$\nforest measurements, can be used to constrain the early stages of reionization\nand the nature of its sources. For a given source model, we find that the\namplitude of the pkSZ power spectra strongly correlates with the start time of\nreionization, and constrains the number of ionizing photons produced by the\nhigh-$z$ source population. Allowing for variations in the source model, this\ncorrelation is weakened by a degeneracy between the reionization history and\nthe effects of source clustering. However, we demonstrate two potential ways of\nbreaking this degeneracy using: (1) measurements of large-scale fluctuations in\nthe Ly$\\alpha$ forest opacity at $z=5-6$, and/or; (2) the shape of the pkSZ\npower spectrum measured in future CMB surveys. Models with highly clustered\nsources yield steeper slopes in the pkSZ power around $\\ell = 3,000$, so\nmeasurements at additional angular scales can be used to break the\nhistory-clustering degeneracy. Our results highlight how future pkSZ\nmeasurements will complement JWST observations to improve our understanding of\nthe ionizing sources near cosmic dawn.",

The west halo (WH) region, which contains the oldest and\nmost metal-poor stellar populations, exhibits a clear age-metallicity relation\n(AMR) with minimal dispersion. This region shows a significant dip of ~0.5 dex\nin metallicity approximately 6 Gyr ago. This was likely caused by a major\nmerger event that subsequently accelerated the star formation rate.

The nature of\nZTF J2008+4449 as a merger remnant is supported by its physical properties: hot\n($35,500\\pm300$ K) and massive ($1.12\\pm0.03$ M$_\\odot$), the white dwarf is\nrapidly rotating with a period of $\\approx$ 6.6 minutes and likely possesses\nexceptionally strong magnetic fields ($\\sim$ 400-600 MG) at its surface.\nRemarkably, we detect a significant period derivative of\n$(1.80\\pm0.09)\\times10^{-12}$ s/s, indicating that the white dwarf is spinning\ndown, and a soft X-ray emission that is inconsistent with photospheric\nemission. As the presence of a mass-transferring stellar or brown dwarf\ncompanion is excluded by infrared photometry, the detected spin down and X-ray\nemission could be tell-tale signs of a magnetically driven wind or of\ninteraction with circumstellar material, possibly originating from the fallback\nof gravitationally bound merger ejecta or from the tidal disruption of a\nplanetary object. We also detect Balmer emission, which requires the presence\nof ionized hydrogen in the vicinity of the white dwarf, showing Doppler shifts\nas high as $\\approx$ 2000 km s$^{-1}$. The unusual variability of the Balmer\nemission on the spin period of the white dwarf is consistent with the trapping\nof a half ring of ionised gas in the magnetosphere of the white dwarf.",

      "content": "We present a novel method of constraining volcanic activity on extrasolar\nterrestrial worlds via characterization of circumstellar plasma tori. Our work\ngeneralizes the physics of the Io plasma torus to propose a hypothetical\ncircumstellar plasma torus generated by exoplanetary volcanism. The\nquasi-steady torus mass is determined by a balance between material injection\nand ejection rates from volcanic activity and corotating magnetospheric\nconvection, respectively. By estimating the Alfv\\'en surfaces of planet-hosting\nstars, we calculate the torus mass-removal timescale for a number of exoplanets\nwith properties amenable to plasma torus construction. Assuming a uniform\ntoroidal geometry comparable to Io's \"warm\" torus, we calculate quasi-steady\ntorus masses inferable from the optical depth of atomic spectral features in\ntorus-contaminated stellar spectra. The calculated quasi-steady masses can be\nused to constrain the volcanic outgassing rates of each species detected in the\ntorus, providing quantitative estimates of bulk volcanic activity and interior\ncomposition with minimal assumptions. Such insight into the interior state of\nan exoplanet is otherwise accessible only after destruction via tidal forces.\nWe demonstrate the feasibility of our method by showcasing known exoplanets\nwhich are susceptible to tidal heating and could generate readily-detectable\ntori with realistic outgassing rates of order 1 ton s$^{-1}$, comparable to the\nIo plasma torus mass injection rate. This methodology may be applied to stellar\nspectra measured with ultraviolet instruments with sufficient resolution to\ndetect atomic lines and sensitivity to recover the ultraviolet continuum of GKM\ndwarf stars. This further motivates the need for ultraviolet instrumentation\nabove Earth's atmosphere.",

      "content": "Wind-forced near-inertial waves (NIWs) propagate through a sea of mesoscale\neddies, which can fundamentally alter their evolution. The nature of this\nNIW--mesoscale interaction depends on how dispersive the waves are. For weakly\ndispersive waves, ray tracing suggests that the NIW frequency should be shifted\nby $\\frac{1}{2}\\zeta$, where $\\zeta$ is the mesoscale vorticity, and that the\nwaves are refracted into anticyclones. Strongly dispersive waves, in contrast,\nretain the large-scale structure of the wind forcing and exhibit a small\nnegative frequency shift. Previous in situ observational studies have indeed\nrevealed varying degrees of NIW--mesoscale interaction. Here, observations of\nNIWs from drifters are used to map the geography of NIW--mesoscale interactions\nglobally, and idealized simulations and a simple model are used to identify the\nunderlying physical processes. Almost everywhere in the ocean, with the notable\nexception of the North Pacific, the NIW frequency is strongly modulated by the\nmesoscale vorticity, with the slope of the frequency shift vs. vorticity taking\nvalues of approximately $0.4$. Concentration of NIW energy into anticyclones is\na common feature throughout the ocean. Other aspects of the observations,\nhowever, show signatures of strongly dispersive waves: a negative frequency\nshift and weaker concentration into anticyclones in regions with strong eddies\nas well as weak modulation of the NIW frequency by mesoscale eddies in the\nNorth Pacific. The signatures of both weakly and strongly dispersive NIW\nbehavior can be rationalized by the geography of the wave dispersiveness and\nthe fact that wind forcing excites multiple vertical modes with different wave\ndispersiveness. These results have implications for NIW-induced mixing in the\nupper-ocean.",

      "content": "In ancient Roman religion and mythology, Mars (Latin: Mārs, pronounced [maːrs]) is the god of war and also an agricultural guardian, a combination characteristic of early Rome. He is the son of Jupiter and Juno, and was pre-eminent among the Roman army's military gods. Most of his festivals were held in March, the month named for him (Latin Martius), and in October, the months which traditionally began and ended the season for both military campaigning and farming.\nUnder the influence of Greek culture, Mars was identified with the Greek god Ares, whose myths were reinterpreted in Roman literature and art under the name of Mars. The character and dignity of Mars differs in fundamental ways from that of his Greek counterpart, who is often treated with contempt and revulsion in Greek literature. Mars's altar in the Campus Martius, the area of Rome that took its name from him, was supposed to have been dedicated by Numa, the peace-loving semi-legendary second king of Rome; in Republican times it was a focus of electoral activities. Augustus shifted the focus of Mars' cult to within the pomerium (Rome's ritual boundary), and built a temple to Mars Ultor as a key religious feature of his new forum.\nUnlike Ares, who was viewed primarily as a destructive and destabilizing force, Mars represented military power as a way to secure peace, and was a father (pater) of the Roman people. In Rome's mythic genealogy and founding, Mars fathered Romulus and Remus through his rape of Rhea Silvia. The wolf was the sacred animal of Mars, with the she-wolf nursing the two founders as children. His love affair with Venus symbolically reconciled two different traditions of Rome's founding; Venus was the divine mother of the hero Aeneas, credited by Vergil as an earlier founder of Rome.",

      "content": "The dynamics of the El Ni\\~no Southern Oscillation (ENSO) are succinctly\ncaptured by the Recharge Oscillator (RO) framework. However, to simulate ENSO\nrealistically, careful choices must be made regarding the RO's key parameters.\nIn particular, nonlinear parameters govern how well the model reproduces key\nENSO asymmetries-El Ni\\~no events tend to be stronger but shorter-lived, often\ntransitioning into La Ni\\~na, whereas La Ni\\~na events are typically weaker but\nmore persistent, sometimes lasting into a second year or beyond. While\namplitude asymmetry has been widely studied within the RO framework, duration\nand transition asymmetries have received little attention, and their underlying\ncauses remain debated. In this study, by systematically exploring the RO\nparameter space-rather than relying on commonly used fitting methods-we\nidentify optimal parameter values that successfully capture key linear and\nnonlinear ENSO characteristics. An analytical expression for the\ntemperature-heat content anomaly slope shows that the choice of heat content\nvariable inherently reflects the sign of the Bjerknes feedback and the ocean\nadjustment timescale. We further show that self-sustained oscillations fail to\nreproduce the observed Nino 3 and 3.4 kurtosis. Finally, we demonstrate that\nincorporating red noise forcing distorts the RO simulated power spectrum and\nadd unnecessary complexity. The most realistic yet simplest RO configuration is\na strongly damped oscillator, with a decay timescale shorter than the dominant\nperiod, forced by multiplicative white noise and influenced by relatively weak\ndeterministic nonlinearities. Identifying these minimal components preserves\nthe conceptual clarity of the RO framework and isolates the core physical\nprocesses underlying ENSO behavior.",

Past analyses of Juno data immensely advanced our\nunderstanding of its auroral acceleration processes, however, few studies\nutilized multiple instruments on Juno in a joint systematic analysis. This\nstudy uses measurements from the Juno Ultraviolet Spectrograph (UVS), the\nJupiter Energetic particle Detector Instrument (JEDI), and the Juno\nMagnetometer (MAG) from the first 20 perijoves. On magnetic field lines\nassociated with the diffuse aurora, we consistently find small-scale magnetic\nfield fluctuations with amplitudes of up to 100 nT on time scales of seconds to\n1 minute. On magnetic field lines directly linked to the main emission, the\nelectron distribution is field-aligned, mostly broad-band in energy, and\naccompanied by large-scale magnetic field perturbations of several 100 nT on\ntime scales of tens of min (except one case). These large-scale perturbations\nare generally associated with quasistatic field-aligned electric currents.\nSmall-scale magnetic fields are not resolved over the main emission zone closer\nthan radial distances 4 Jovian radii due to the digitization limit of the\nmagnetometer. However, in all cases where Juno crosses the main auroral field\nlines beyond 4RJ, the digitization limit is significantly reduced and we detect\nsmall-scale magnetic field fluctuations of 2 nT to 10 nT consistent with a\nturbulent spectrum. Associated energy fluxes projected to Jupiter can exceed\n1000 mW/m2.

The center of gravity of the ribbon would be exactly in geosynchronous orbit, so that the ribbon would always stay above the anchor point. Vehicles would climb the ribbon powered by a beam of energy projected from the surface of the Earth. Building a space elevator requires materials and techniques that do not currently exist. A variety of Space Elevator competitions have been held in order to stimulate the development of such materials and techniques.\nSpace elevators were first conceived in 1895, but until the discovery of carbon nanotubes, no technology was envisioned that could make them possible. Building an actual elevator is still out of reach, but the directions for research are clear. This makes the area ripe for incentive prizes like the X Prize, and prizes and competitions have been set up since 2005 to encourage the development of relevant technologies. There are two main areas of research remaining, and these are where the competitions focus: building cables (\"a Tether challenge\"), and climbing and descending cables (\"a Power Beam challenge\").\nIn a Power Beam Challenge, each team designs and builds a climber (a machine capable of traveling up and down a tether ribbon). In a Tether challenge, each team attempts to build the longest and strongest cable. In the Power Beam challenge climber carry a payload. Power is beamed from a transmitter to a receiver on the climber. With each competition, the tethers reach higher altitudes, and the climbers are expected to climb further. Each competition can have minimum lengths and maximum weight per meter for cables, and minimum speed and distance goals for climbers.",

      "content": "Diffusion models are a powerful tool for probabilistic forecasting, yet most\napplications in high-dimensional chaotic systems predict future snapshots\none-by-one. This common approach struggles to model complex temporal\ndependencies and fails to explicitly account for the progressive growth of\nuncertainty inherent to such systems. While rolling diffusion frameworks, which\napply increasing noise to forecasts at longer lead times, have been proposed to\naddress this, their integration with state-of-the-art, high-fidelity diffusion\ntechniques remains a significant challenge. We tackle this problem by\nintroducing Elucidated Rolling Diffusion Models (ERDM), the first framework to\nsuccessfully unify a rolling forecast structure with the principled, performant\ndesign of Elucidated Diffusion Models (EDM). To do this, we adapt the core EDM\ncomponents-its noise schedule, network preconditioning, and Heun sampler-to the\nrolling forecast setting. The success of this integration is driven by three\nkey contributions: (i) a novel loss weighting scheme that focuses model\ncapacity on the mid-range forecast horizons where determinism gives way to\nstochasticity; (ii) an efficient initialization strategy using a pre-trained\nEDM for the initial window; and (iii) a bespoke hybrid sequence architecture\nfor robust spatiotemporal feature extraction under progressive denoising. On 2D\nNavier-Stokes simulations and ERA5 global weather forecasting at 1.5^\\circ\nresolution, ERDM consistently outperforms key diffusion-based baselines,\nincluding conditional autoregressive EDM.

Travelling on Vostok 1, Gagarin completed one orbit of Earth on 12 April 1961, with his flight taking 108 minutes. By achieving this major milestone for the Soviet Union amidst the Space Race, he became an international celebrity and was awarded many medals and titles, including his country's highest distinction: Hero of the Soviet Union.\nHailing from the village of Klushino in the Russian SFSR, Gagarin was a foundryman at a steel plant in Lyubertsy in his youth. He later joined the Soviet Air Forces as a pilot and was stationed at the Luostari Air Base, near the Norway–Soviet Union border, before his selection for the Soviet space programme alongside five other cosmonauts. Following his spaceflight, Gagarin became the deputy training director of the Cosmonaut Training Centre, which was later named after him. He was also elected as a deputy of the Soviet of the Union in 1962 and then to the Soviet of Nationalities, the lower and upper chambers of the Supreme Soviet respectively.\nVostok 1 was Gagarin's only spaceflight, but he served as the backup crew to Soyuz 1, which ended in a fatal crash, killing his friend and fellow cosmonaut Vladimir Komarov. Fearful that a high-level national hero might be killed, Soviet officials banned Gagarin from participating in further spaceflights. After completing training at the Zhukovsky Air Force Engineering Academy in February 1968, he was again allowed to fly regular aircraft. However, Gagarin died five weeks later, when the MiG-15 that he was piloting with flight instructor Vladimir Seryogin crashed near the town of Kirzhach.",

Previous challenges in constraining $f_\\mathrm{e}$ over\nlarge areas stemmed from the limitations of observational tracers and chemical\nmodels. Recent models have identified molecular line ratios that can trace\n$f_\\mathrm{e}$ in different environments within molecular clouds. In this\nstudy, we analyze various molecular lines in the 3-4 mm range to derive the\nionization fraction across the Orion B giant molecular cloud. We focus on dense\nand translucent gas, exploring variations with gas density ($n$) and the\nfar-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation field ($G_0$). Our findings show that the\nionization fraction ranges from $10^{-5.5}$ to $10^{-4}$ in translucent gas and\n$10^{-8}$ to $10^{-6}$ in dense gas.

In translucent gas,\ndiffering line ratios yield consistent fe values, indicating the importance of\nelectron excitation of HCN and HNC. For dense gas, we recommend using the\nCN(1-0)/N$_2$H$^+$(1-0) ratio for upper limits on fe and\nC$^{18}$O(1-0)/HCO$^+$(1-0) for lower limits. In translucent environments,\nCCH(1-0)/HNC(1-0) effectively traces $f_\\mathrm{e}$.

      "content": "Measuring properties of young stellar objects (YSOs) is necessary for probing\nthe pre-main-sequence evolution of stars. As YSOs exhibit complex geometry,\nmeasurement generally entails comparing observed radiation to template\npopulations of radiative-transfer model YSO spectral energy distributions\n(SEDs). Due to uncertainty on the precise mechanics of star formation, the\nproperties inferred for YSOs using these models often depend strongly on the\nassumed accretion history. We develop a framework for predicting observable\nproperties of YSOs that is agnostic to the underlying accretion history,\nenabling comparison between theories. This framework links a set of\nradiative-transfer SEDs with protostellar evolutionary tracks to create models\nof evolving YSOs. Unlike previous works, we directly relate evolution models to\nobservables through theoretical physical parameters rather than through\nintermediate, observationally derived analogues. We make flux predictions for\nYSOs corresponding to stars with birth masses from 0.2 to 50 $M_\\odot$ during\ntheir accretion phase following isothermal-sphere, turbulent-core, and\ncompetitive accretion histories, showing that these histories may be\nobservationally distinguished by examining the 100-$\\mu$m and 3-mm fluxes of a\nYSO. We discuss the impact of dust models and parameter ranges on the output of\nradiative transfer simulations through a comparison to another SED model grid.\nWe quantify the degree of confusion between YSO Stages and Classes across a\nwide range of physical scenarios; for each, we calculate confusion matrices\nthat enable inference of the number of objects of a given Stage from an\nobserved population. Finally, we critically examine the physical significance\nof various literature Stage and Class definitions.",

      "content": "NASA Astronaut Group 8 was a group of 35 astronauts announced on January 16, 1978. It was the first NASA selection since Group 6 in 1967, and was the largest group to that date. The class was the first to include female and minority astronauts; of the 35 selected, six were women, one of them being Jewish American, three were African American, and one was Asian American. Due to the long delay between the last Apollo lunar mission in 1972 and the first flight of the Space Shuttle in 1981, few astronauts from the older groups remained, and they were outnumbered by the newcomers, who became known as the Thirty-Five New Guys (TFNG). Since then, a new group of candidates has been selected roughly every two years.\nIn Astronaut Group 8, two different kinds of astronaut were selected: pilots and mission specialists. The group consisted of 15 pilots, all test pilots, and 20 mission specialists. NASA stopped sending non-pilots for one year of pilot training. It also ceased appointing astronauts on selection. Instead, starting with this group, new selections were considered astronaut candidates rather than fully-fledged astronauts until they finished their training.\nFour members of this group, Dick Scobee, Judith Resnik, Ellison Onizuka, and Ronald McNair, died in the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster. These four, plus Shannon Lucid, received the Congressional Space Medal of Honor, giving this astronaut class five total recipients of this top NASA award.  This is second only to the New Nine class of 1962, which received seven. The careers of the TFNGs would span the entire Space Shuttle Program. They reshaped the image of the American astronaut into one that more closely resembled the diversity of American society, and opened the doors for others that would follow.",

Alternative names include Ulidia, which is the Latin form of Ulaid, and in Cóiced, Irish for 'the Fifth'. The king of Ulaid was called the rí Ulad or rí in Chóicid.\nUlaid also refers to a people of early Ireland, and it is from them that the province of Ulster derives its name. Some of the dynasties in the over-kingdom claimed descent from the Ulaid, but others are cited as being of Cruithin descent. In historical documents, the term Ulaid was used to refer to the population group of which the Dál Fiatach was the ruling dynasty. As such, the title rí Ulad held two meanings: over-king of the Kingdom of Ulaid and king of the Ulaid people, as in the Dál Fiatach.\nThe Ulaid feature prominently in the Ulster Cycle of Irish mythology. According to legend, the ancient territory of Ulaid spanned the whole of the modern province of Ulster, excluding County Cavan, but including County Louth. Its southern border was said to stretch from the River Drowes in the west to the River Boyne in the east. At the onset of the historic period of Irish history in the 6th century, the territory of Ulaid was largely confined to east of the River Bann, as it is said to have lost land to the Airgíalla and the Northern Uí Néill. Ulaid ceased to exist after its conquest in the late 12th century by the Anglo-Norman knight John de Courcy, and was replaced with the Earldom of Ulster.\nAn individual from Ulaid was known in Irish as an Ultach, the nominative plural being Ultaigh.\nThis name lives on in the surname McAnulty or McNulty, from mac an Ultaigh ('son of the Ulsterman').",

      "content": "Absorbing aerosols, such as brown carbon (BrC) and absorbing secondary\norganic aerosols (SOA), has attracted broad interest due to their importance\nfor climate and human health. The pronounced time-dependence of light\nabsorption during aging renders the precise estimation of their impact on\nglobal warming difficult. Single particle studies of such aerosols would be\nvery useful to better understand their aging in the atmosphere through\nprocesses such as photochemistry. However previously proposed optical traps\ncannot continuously trap particles whose absorption state changes from strongly\nabsorbing to non-absorbing or vice versa. Some of the traps presented can\nisolate absorbing and non-absorbing particles, but require mechanical alignment\nof the trap depending on the strength of particle absorption. However,\nmechanical realignment is not compatible with continuous trapping and\nobservation. Here, we introduce a flexible optical universal trap which does\nnot require mechanical realignment. The versatility of the trap relies on four\ntrapping beams - either vortex Laguerre- Gaussian (LG) or fundamental Gaussian\nbeams - which are modulated with a spatial light modulator (SLM), The\nperformance of the trap is demonstrated by trapping different types of\nabsorbing and non-absorbing particles. We also show that the trap can be used\nto observe the photochemical reaction of aqueous droplets containing fulvic\nacid, a common component of BrC. Digital holography measurements demonstrate\nthat the confinement of the particles in the trap can be controlled by changing\nthe orbital angular momentum (OAM) of the LG beams. The study also shows that\nspectroscopy measurements, such as fluorescence and Raman scattering, are\npossible in all configurations of the proposed trap.",

Mitigating UHIs requires urban planners to first\nestimate how urban heat is influenced by different land use types (LUTs) and\ndrivers across scales - from synoptic-scale climatic background processes to\nsmall-scale urban- and scale-bridging features. This study proposes to classify\nthese drivers into driving (D), urban (U), and local (L) features,\nrespectively. To increase interpretability and enhance computation efficiency,\na LUT-distinguishing machine learning approach is proposed as a fast emulator\nfor Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled to a Single-Layer Urban\nCanopy Model (WRF-SLUCM) to predict ground- (TSK) and 2-meter air temperature\n(T2). Using random forests (RFs) with extreme gradient boosting (XGB) trained\non WRF-SLUCM output over Zurich, Switzerland, during heatwave (HW) periods in\n2017 and 2019, this study proposes LUT-based (LB) models that categorize\nfeatures by scales and practical controllability, allowing optional categorical\nweighting. This approach enables category-specific feature ranking and\nsensitivity estimation of T2 and TSK to most important small-scale drivers -\nmost notably surface emissivity, albedo, and leaf area index (LAI). Models\nemploying the LB framework are statistically significantly more accurate than\nmodels that do not, with higher performance when more HW data is included in\ntraining. With RF-XGB robustly performing optimal with unit weights, the method\nsubstantially increase interpretability.

By the 1st century BC, the celebration had been extended until 23 December, for a total of seven days of festivities. The holiday was celebrated with a sacrifice at the Temple of Saturn, in the Roman Forum, and a public banquet, followed by private gift-giving, continual partying, and a carnival atmosphere that overturned Roman social norms: gambling was permitted, and masters provided table service for their slaves as it was seen as a time of liberty for both slaves and freedmen alike. A common custom was the election of a \"King of the Saturnalia\", who gave orders to people, which were followed and presided over the merrymaking. The gifts exchanged were usually gag gifts or small figurines made of wax or pottery known as sigillaria. The poet Catullus called it \"the best of days\".\nSaturnalia was the Roman equivalent to the earlier Greek holiday of Kronia, which was celebrated during the Attic month of Hekatombaion in late midsummer. It held theological importance for some Romans, who saw it as a restoration of the ancient Golden Age, when the world was ruled by Saturn. The Neoplatonist philosopher Porphyry interpreted the freedom associated with Saturnalia as symbolizing the \"freeing of souls into immortality\". Saturnalia may have influenced some of the customs associated with later celebrations in western Europe occurring in midwinter, particularly traditions associated with Christmas, the Feast of the Holy Innocents, and Epiphany. In particular, the historical western European Christmas custom of electing a \"Lord of Misrule\" may have its roots in Saturnalia celebrations.",

Their phenomenology does not fit\nexactly in any other class, although it might resemble that of radio magnetars\nor of white dwarf (WD) radio emitting binary systems. Notably, two LPTs with\nconfirmed multi-wavelength counterparts have been identified as synchronised\nwhite dwarf-M dwarf binaries (polars). Meanwhile, systems such as AR Scorpii\nand J1912-44 exhibit short-period pulsations in a hr-tight orbit, with\npolarized radio emission proposed to be generated by the interaction of the WD\nmagnetosphere with the low-mass companion wind.\n  Here we demonstrate that both LPTs and WD binary pulsars can be explained\nwithin a single geometric model in which radio emission is triggered when the\nmagnetic pole of a rotating white dwarf intersects its companion's wind in the\nbinary orbital plane. We use a 36-year timing baseline to infer the orbital\nperiod and binary geometry solely from radio data of GPM J1839-10, the\nlongest-active LPT known. The model naturally predicts its intermittent\nemission and double-pulse structure. Crucially, we show that the beat period\nbetween the spin and the orbit matches the observed pulse substructure and\npolarisation signatures, providing strong support for the model. Applying this\nmodel to the WD binary pulsar J1912-44, it can also reproduce the system\nemission and geometry. Our results place GPM J1839-10, and other LPTs in\ngeneral and radio emitting WD binaries, at different stages of a continuum\nbetween intermediate and synchronised polars, suggesting a unified population\nof magnetic WD binaries driving coherent radio emission.",

The life-support system may supply air, water and food. It must also maintain the correct body temperature, an acceptable pressure on the body and deal with the body's waste products. Shielding against harmful external influences such as radiation and micro-meteorites may also be necessary. Components of the life-support system are life-critical, and are designed and constructed using safety engineering techniques.\nIn underwater diving, the breathing apparatus is considered to be life support equipment, and a saturation diving system is considered a life-support system – the personnel who are responsible for operating it are called life support technicians. The concept can also be extended to submarines, crewed submersibles and atmospheric diving suits, where the breathing gas requires treatment to remain respirable, and the occupants are isolated from the outside ambient pressure and temperature.\nMedical life-support systems include heart-lung machines, medical ventilators and dialysis equipment.",

These\nregions are kinematically cold (|v| < 40 km/s), prompting the alternative\nhypothesis that the correlation reflects an age bias: planetary systems in\noverdensities are systematically younger and therefore less likely to have\nundergone tidal inspiral and destruction. We test whether the apparent excess\nof HJs in phase space overdensities arises from differences in intrinsic host\nproperties -- mass, metallicity, age -- which may correlate with phase space\ndensity or whether there is evidence for an additional environmental effect. We\nderive homogeneous estimates for the mass, metallicity, and age of\nplanet-hosting stars using 2MASS and Gaia DR3 photometry, parallaxes, and\nself-consistent spectroscopic and spectrophotometric observables. In a sample\nof 2265 confirmed exoplanet hosts, we find a significant relative excess of HJs\norbiting stars in overdense regions. However, we also find that overdensities\npreferentially host younger, more massive, and more metal-rich stars compared\nto underdensities. After correcting for these differences, either by detrending\nthe phase space density against age or by matching host properties across\nsubsamples, we find no significant differences in the HJ populations between\nover- and underdense regions.

However, LEO satellites fly within the upper atmosphere region that\nexerts significant drag forces to their orbits, reducing their lifetimes, and\nincreasing collision risks during dynamic events, like geomagnetic storms. Such\nconditions can become more severe during geomagnetic storms, particularly\nduring extreme events. In this work, we use two-line element (TLE) satellite\ntracking data to investigate geomagnetic activity effects on the reentries of\n523 Starlink satellites from 2020 to 2024. This period coincides with the\nrising phase of solar cycle 25, which has shown itself to be more intense than\nthe previous solar cycle. We derive satellite altitudes and velocities from TLE\nfiles and perform a superposed epoch analysis, the first with hundreds of\nsimilar satellites. Even with limitedly accurate TLE data, our results\nindisputably show that satellites reenter faster with higher geomagnetic\nactivity. This is explained by the fastest orbital decay rates (in km/day) of\nthe satellites caused by increased drag forces. We also find that prediction\nerrors, defined as the difference between the epochs of actual reentries and\npredicted reentries at reference altitudes, increase with geomagnetic activity.\nAs a result, we clearly show that the intense solar activity of the current\nsolar cycle has already had significant impacts on Starlink reentries. This is\na very exciting time in satellite orbital drag research, since the number of\nsatellites in LEO and solar activity are the highest ever observed in human\nhistory.",

      "content": "We formulate and analyze a new class of electrically charged black hole (BH)\nsolutions in Lorentz-violating gravity, where nonlinear ModMax electrodynamics\nis nonminimally coupled to a Kalb-Ramond (KR) two-form field. The spontaneous\nbreaking of local Lorentz symmetry is triggered by a nonzero vacuum expectation\nvalue of the KR field, characterized by a small dimensionless parameter $\\ell$.\nTo incorporate both standard and phantom sectors, we introduce a discrete\nsign-flip parameter $\\zeta = \\pm1$, which flips the gauge-kinetic terms in the\nphantom ($\\zeta = -1$) branch. Assuming a vanishing cosmological constant and a\nself-interacting potential with minimum $V' = 0$, we obtain exact analytical\nsolutions for the metric function and electric potential. The resulting\nspacetime interpolates between Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordstrom, and ModMax\nBHs, with curvature scalars showing deviations controlled by $(\\ell, \\gamma,\n\\zeta)$. We study scalar, electromagnetic, and gravitational perturbations\nusing both frequency-domain (Pade-averaged WKB) and time-domain\n(Gundlach-Price-Pullin plus Prony) methods. We find that increasing either\n$\\ell$ or the ModMax parameter $\\gamma$ enhances the real and imaginary parts\nof QNMs, indicating higher oscillation frequencies and faster damping,\nespecially in the phantom sector. The effective potentials deepen under phantom\ndeformation, supporting more tightly bound modes. Furthermore, we analyze the\ngreybody factors and compute the sparsity $\\eta$ of Hawking radiation, which\nquantifies the nonthermal character of particle emission. We show that $\\eta$\nis significantly affected by $\\ell$, decreasing with increasing Lorentz\nviolation and asymptotically approaching a scaled version of the Schwarzschild\nvalue.",

      "content": "A planetarium (pl.: planetariums or planetaria) is a theatre built primarily for presenting educational and entertaining shows about astronomy and the night sky, or for training in celestial navigation.\nA dominant feature of most planetariums is the large dome-shaped projection screen onto which scenes of stars, planets, and other celestial objects can be made to appear and move realistically to simulate their motion. The projection can be created in various ways, such as a star ball, slide projector, video, fulldome projector systems, and lasers. Typical systems can be set to simulate the sky at any point in time, past or present, and often to depict the night sky as it would appear from any point of latitude on Earth.\nPlanetaria range in size from the 37 meter dome in St. Petersburg, Russia (called \"Planetarium No 1\") to three-meter inflatable portable domes where attendees sit on the floor. The largest planetarium in the Western Hemisphere is the Jennifer Chalsty Planetarium at Liberty Science Center in New Jersey, its dome measuring 27 meters in diameter. The Birla Planetarium, Kolkata in India is the largest by seating capacity, having 630 seats. In North America, the Hayden Planetarium at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City has the greatest number of seats, at 423.\nThe term planetarium is sometimes used generically to describe other devices which illustrate the Solar System, such as a computer simulation or an orrery. Planetarium software refers to a software application that renders a three-dimensional image of the sky onto a two-dimensional computer screen, or in a virtual reality headset for a 3D representation. The term planetarian is used to describe a member of the professional staff of a planetarium.",

Some of the electronics contained within the instrument unit are a digital computer, analog flight control computer, emergency detection system, inertial guidance platform, control accelerometers, and control rate gyros. The instrument unit (IU) for Saturn V was designed by NASA at Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) and was developed from the Saturn I IU. NASA's contractor to manufacture the Saturn V Instrument Unit was International Business Machines (IBM).\nOne of the unused instrument units is on display at the Steven F.

The plaque for the unit has the following inscription:\n\nThe Saturn V rocket, which sent astronauts to the Moon, used inertial guidance, a self-contained system that guided the rocket's trajectory.  The rocket booster had a guidance system separate from those on the command and lunar modules.  It was contained in an instrument unit like this one, a ring located between the rocket's third stage and the command and lunar modules.  The ring contained the basic guidance system components—a stable platform, accelerometers, a digital computer, and control electronics—as well as radar, telemetry, and other units.\nThe instrument unit's stable platform was based on an experimental unit for the German V-2 rocket of World War II.

This work uses IRAM 30m data to\nconstrain the D/H ratio of HCN, HNC, and N2H+ as well as the 14N/15N ratio of\nHCN and HNC. The observed abundances have been modeled using the chemical code\nDNAUTILUS 2.0. Deuterated compounds are detected in all of our sample cores,\nwith average DNC/HNC, DCN/HCN, and N2D+/N2H+ values of 0.054$\\pm$0.019,\n0.036$\\pm$0.033, and 0.15$\\pm$0.11, respectively. The deuterium fractions\n(Dfrac) show a weak correlation with temperature and a large scatter that\nreflects that other factors such as core evolution could also play a\nsignificant role. Our chemical model is able to reproduce all the observed\nvalues with 0.2-0.3 Myr in Taurus and 0.3-0.5 Myr in Perseus and Orion. The\n14N/15N isotopic ratio is found to be different between HCN/HC15N (430$\\pm$120)\nand HNC/H15NC (296$\\pm$64). We find no correlation between these ratios and the\ndeuterium fractions, but we report a weak correlation with temperature. The\nDfrac of HCN, HNC, and N2H+ can be used as evolutionary tracers of starless\ncores as long as the physical parameters are well constrained. The HCN/HC15N\nand HNC/H15NC ratios are not correlated with Dfrac, suggesting that the\ndetected variations are not correlated with the core evolutionary stage. The\naverage value of the HCN/HC15N ratio in our sample is significantly higher than\nthe values measured in protostars and protoplanetary disks, possibly indicating\nthat nitrogen fractionation processes are taking place during the protostellar\nphase.",

      "content": "We introduce a new measure for fair and meaningful comparisons of\nsingle-valued output from artificial intelligence based weather prediction\n(AIWP) and numerical weather prediction (NWP) models, called potential\ncontinuous ranked probability score (PC). In a nutshell, we subject the\ndeterministic backbone of physics-based and data-driven models post hoc to the\nsame statistical postprocessing technique, namely, isotonic distributional\nregression (IDR). Then we find PC as the mean continuous ranked probability\nscore (CRPS) of the postprocessed probabilistic forecasts. The nonnegative PC\nmeasure quantifies potential predictive performance and is invariant under\nstrictly increasing transformations of the model output. PC attains its most\ndesirable value of zero if, and only if, the weather outcome Y is a fixed,\nnon-decreasing function of the model output X. The PC measure is recorded in\nthe unit of the outcome, has an upper bound of one half times the mean absolute\ndifference between outcomes, and serves as a proxy for the mean CRPS of\nreal-time, operational probabilistic products. When applied to WeatherBench 2\ndata, our approach demonstrates that the data-driven GraphCast model\noutperforms the leading, physics-based European Centre for Medium Range Weather\nForecasts (ECMWF) high-resolution (HRES) model. Furthermore, the PC measure for\nthe HRES model aligns exceptionally well with the mean CRPS of the operational\nECMWF ensemble.

It stars Trevante Rhodes, André Holland, Janelle Monáe in her first film appearance, Ashton Sanders, Jharrel Jerome in his feature film debut, Naomie Harris, and Mahershala Ali. \nThe film presents three stages in the life of the main character: his childhood, adolescence, and early adult life. It explores the difficulties he faces with his homosexuality and identity as a black homosexual man, including the physical and emotional abuse he endures growing up. Filmed in Miami, Florida, beginning in 2015, Moonlight premiered at the Telluride Film Festival on September 2, 2016. It was released in the United States on October 21, 2016, by A24, receiving critical acclaim with praise towards its editing, cinematography, score, Jenkins's direction and screenplay, and handling of the themes of sexuality and masculinity. The performances of Harris and Ali also received widespread acclaim. It grossed over $65 million worldwide.\nMoonlight has been cited as one of the best films of the 21st century. The film won the Academy Award for Best Picture—along with Best Supporting Actor (Ali) and Best Adapted Screenplay—from a total of eight nominations, at the 89th Academy Awards. It was released as the first LGBTQ-themed mass-marketed feature film with an all-black cast and was, at the time of its release, the second-lowest-grossing film domestically (behind The Hurt Locker) to win the Oscar for Best Picture. Joi McMillon became the first black woman to be nominated for an Editing Oscar, and Mahershala Ali became the first Muslim to win an acting Oscar.",

In 2015, it was estimated that Chile would contain more than 50% of the global astronomical infrastructure by 2030. In the Atacama Desert region of northern Chile, the skies are exceptionally clear and dry for more than 300 days of the year. These conditions have attracted the world's scientific community to develop highly ambitious astronomical projects in the Atacama Desert.\nChile's diverse and active astronomical community includes Chilean and international professionals, including astronomers, engineers, students, and teachers, as well as amateurs.\nThe first documented report of an astronomical measurement carried out in Chile was the observation of a lunar eclipse by the soldier Pedro Cuadrado Chavino in June 1582. He used a classic Greek method to establish the latitude of the city of Valdivia based on measurements during the eclipse. Three centuries thereafter, in 1849 under the government of Manuel Bulnes, a scientific mission organized by the U.S. Navy that was led by James Melville Gilliss arrived in Chile to observe Venus and Mars to determine the distance between the Earth and the Sun. Gilliss' mission established the first astronomical observatory in the Cerro Santa Lucia (Santiago). Three years thereafter, in 1852, the facilities comprising that observatory were transferred to Chile and the National Astronomical Observatory was born.\nDuring the second half of the 20th century, observatories owned and operated by organizations in the U.S. and Europe were constructed in various locations in the north of the country: La Silla, Cerro Tololo, Las Campanas and later Cerro Paranal, Cerro Pachon and Chajnantor.",

      "content": "The planet Venus has been used as a setting in fiction since before the 19th century. Its opaque cloud cover gave science fiction writers free rein to speculate on conditions at its surface—a \"cosmic Rorschach test\", in the words of science fiction author Stephen L. Gillett. The planet was often depicted as warmer than Earth but still habitable by humans. Depictions of Venus as a lush, verdant paradise, an oceanic planet, or fetid swampland, often inhabited by dinosaur-like beasts or other monsters, became common in early pulp science fiction, particularly between the 1930s and 1950s. Some other stories portrayed it as a desert, or invented more exotic settings. The absence of a common vision resulted in Venus not developing a coherent fictional mythology, in contrast to the image of Mars in fiction.\nWhen included, the native sentient inhabitants, Venusians, were often portrayed as gentle, ethereal and beautiful. The planet's associations with the Roman goddess Venus and femininity in general is reflected in many works' portrayals of Venusians. Depictions of Venusian societies have varied both in level of development and type of governance. In addition to humans visiting Venus, several stories feature Venusians coming to Earth—most often to enlighten humanity, but occasionally for warlike purposes. \nFrom the mid-20th century on, as the reality of Venus's harsh surface conditions became known, the early tropes of adventures in Venusian tropics mostly gave way to more realistic stories. The planet became portrayed instead as a hostile, toxic inferno, with stories changing focus to topics of the planet's colonization and terraforming, although the vision of tropical Venus is occasionally revisited in intentionally retro stories.",

Their potential detection through gamma-ray\nsignatures arising from Hawking radiation would provide definitive evidence for\ntheir existence and constrain their contribution to the DM abundance. Unlike\nconventional DM candidates, PBHs emit a unique, thermal-like spectrum of\nparticles as they evaporate, including photons, neutrinos, and possible\nbeyond-the-Standard Model particles. Future high-sensitivity gamma-ray\nobservatories, such as e-ASTROGAM and other next-generation telescopes, will\nplay a pivotal role in this search. With improved energy resolution and\nsensitivity, these missions can disentangle PBH-originating photons from\nastrophysical backgrounds, probe subtle spectral features such as multi-peak\nstructures, and test exotic evaporation models. Such observations could either\nconfirm PBHs as a viable DM component or place stringent limits on their\nabundance across critical mass windows. In this work, we explore the\ndistinguishing features of a double-peaked gamma-ray spectrum produced by PBHs,\nfocusing on the asteroid-mass window ($10^{15}$ g to $10^{17}$ g), where\nHawking radiation peaks in the MeV to GeV range. Using a likelihood-based\nanalysis, we demonstrate how future missions could discriminate between single-\nand double-peaked PBH scenarios, the latter arising in cosmological models\npredicting multi-modal PBH mass distributions. Our results highlight the\ndiagnostic power of spectral shape analysis in identifying PBH populations and\nconstrain the parameter space for which a double-peaked signal could be\ndetectable above background.",

      "content": "This work explores key conceptual limitations in data-driven modeling of\nmultiscale dynamical systems, focusing on neural emulators and stochastic\nclimate modeling. A skillful climate model should capture both stationary\nstatistics and responses to external perturbations. While current\nautoregressive neural models often reproduce the former, they typically\nstruggle with the latter. We begin by analyzing a low-dimensional dynamical\nsystem to expose, by analogy, fundamental limitations that persist in\nhigh-dimensional settings. Specifically, we construct neural stochastic models\nunder two scenarios: one where the full state vector is observed, and another\nwith only partial observations (i.e. a subset of variables). In the first case,\nthe models accurately capture both equilibrium statistics and forced responses\nin ensemble mean and variance. In the more realistic case of partial\nobservations, two key challenges emerge: (i) identifying the \\textit{proper}\nvariables to model, and (ii) parameterizing the influence of unobserved degrees\nof freedom. These issues are not specific to neural networks but reflect\nfundamental limitations of data-driven modeling and the need to target the slow\ndynamics of the system. We argue that physically grounded strategies -- such as\ncoarse-graining and stochastic parameterizations -- are critical, both\nconceptually and practically, for the skillful emulation of complex systems\nlike the coupled climate system. Building on these insights, we turn to a more\nrealistic application: a stochastic reduced neural model of the sea surface\ntemperature field and the net radiative flux at the top of the atmosphere,\nassessing its stationary statistics, response to temperature forcing, and\ninterpretability.",

This is typically done by fitting the optimal\nkappa distribution function and interpreting its so-called q-statistics to\ncharacterize the magnetic field increments. Using this approach, recent\nfindings concluded that beyond a certain distance, the magnetic field\nincrements in the very local interstellar medium (VLISM) follow Gaussian\nstatistics, unlike those both inside the heliosphere and in the region just\nbeyond the widely accepted heliopause location, raising questions about the\nheliopause identification. This study explores this issue in detail by (1)\noptimizing the derivation of the distribution function, (2) examining whether\nand how the results depend on increment windows and time periods, and (3)\ndetermining the statistical behavior of the examined time series. Using\nmagnetic field measurements from Voyager 1, we present two independent\ntechniques and introduce a statistical framework to systematically analyze the\ndistributions of magnetic field increments. Contrary to previous findings, we\nfind that magnetic field increments in the VLISM do not follow a Gaussian\ndistribution (k to infinity) and instead are in the non-Gaussian range of kappa\nvalues (3-7, when analyzed on a 30-day statistical period). We further\ndemonstrate how erroneous, statistically induced results can arise that mimic\nGaussian-like results when mixing different structures in such analyses. Our\nresults show that Voyager 1 still travels in the intermittent magnetic field\nenvironment of the VLISM.",

      "title": "Impact of Forecast Stability on Navigational Contrail Avoidance",
      "content": "Mitigating contrail-induced warming by re-routing flights around\ncontrail-forming regions requires accurate and stable forecasts of the state of\nthe upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. Forecast stability (i.e.,\nconsistency between forecast cycles with different lead times) is particularly\nimportant for \"pre-tactical\" contrail avoidance strategies that adjust routes\nbased on forecasts with lead times as long as 24-48 hours. However, no study to\ndate has systematically quantified the degree to which forecast stability\nlimits the effectiveness of pre-tactical avoidance. This study addresses this\ngap by comparing contrail forecasts generated using ECMWF HRES weather\nforecasts with lead times up to 48 hours to contrail hindcasts generated based\non ECMWF ERA5 reanalysis. An analysis of forecast errors shows low pointwise\nconsistency between persistent-contrail-forming regions in forecasts and\nreanalysis, with pointwise error rates similar to those found in previous\ncomparisons of contrail-forming regions in reanalysis and reality. However, we\nalso show that spatial errors in the locations of contrail-forming regions are\nrelatively small, both when forecasts are compared to reanalysis and when\nreanalysis is compared to in-situ measurements. Finally, we show that designing\na trajectory optimizer to take advantage of relatively small spatial errors\nallows flight trajectory optimizations based on contrail forecasts to reduce\ncontrail climate forcing evaluated based on reanalysis by 80-90% at the 8-24\nhour lead times most relevant to flight planning, with fuel penalties under\n0.4%. Our results show that forecasts with lead times relevant to flight\nplanning are stable enough to be used for pre-tactical contrail avoidance.",

      "content": "Space launch market competition is the manifestation of market forces in the launch service provider business. In particular it is the trend of competitive dynamics among payload transport capabilities at diverse prices having a greater influence on launch purchasing than the traditional political considerations of country of manufacture or the national entity using, regulating or licensing the launch service.\nFollowing the advent of spaceflight technology in the late 1950s, space launch services came into being, exclusively by national programs. Later in the 20th century commercial operators became important customers of launch providers. International competition for the communications satellite payload subset of the launch market was increasingly influenced by commercial considerations. However, even during this period, for both commercial- and government-entity-launched commsats, the launch service providers for these payloads used launch vehicles built to government specifications, and with state-provided development funding exclusively.\nIn the early 2010s, five decades after humans first developed spaceflight technology, privately-developed launch vehicle systems and space launch service offerings emerged. Companies now faced economic incentives rather than the principally political incentives of the earlier decades. The space launch business experienced a dramatic lowering of per-unit prices along with the addition of entirely new capabilities, bringing about a new phase of competition in the space launch market.\nIn 2024 it was reported that, counting all global spaceflight and launch activity, SpaceX, utilizing its Falcon family of rockets had launched close to 87% of all upmass on Earth in the year 2023.",

It consists of the twelfth and thirteenth episodes of the season, which were initially broadcast in the United States on FX on March 15 and March 22, 2012, respectively. In the installment, Commander Anthony Drake (Bryan Cranston) urges the field agents of ISIS to travel onto the spacecraft Horizon to aid in ceasing any attacks. After entering and defeating the resistant \"mutineers\", the field agents are eventually kidnapped by Drake and his aggregation, whose real objective is to colonize and populate the humans on Mars.\n\"Space Race\", which was written and directed by series creator Adam Reed, is a parody of the 1979 spy film Moonraker, the eleventh film of the James Bond cinema franchise. Additionally, the episode is instilled with multiple references to science fiction cinema, including the popular films Aliens, The Right Stuff, and Star Wars Episode IV, as well as political events such as the  Cold War's space exploration competition between the Soviet Union and the United States. Cranston guest starred in the program, alongside actor Dave Willis, who reprised his role as recurring antagonist Barry Dylan.\n\"Space Race: Part I\" received overwhelmingly positive reviews from critics, who praised the episode's humor and character developments. Although it acquired positive critiques from commentators, the humor and general execution of \"Space Race: Part II\" was deemed inferior to its predecessor. \"Space Race: Part I\" garnered 1.157 million viewers during its initial airing, while \"Space Race: Part II\" attained 1.33 million viewers upon airing, consequently becoming the most viewed episode of Archer's third season.",

In this paper,\nwe perform three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of meteoroid entry using\nthe Athena++ code, coupled with chemistry calculations via Cantera to model the\nnon-equilibrium chemistry triggered by atmospheric entry. Our aerodynamical\nsimulations reveal the formation of complex shock structures, including\nsecondary shock waves, which influence the thermodynamic evolution of the gas\nmedium. By tracking thermodynamic parameters along streamlines, we analyze the\neffects of shock heating and subsequent expansion cooling on chemical reaction\npathways.

Applying our model to Titan, we demonstrate that\norganic matter can be synthesized in the present environment of Titan. Also, we\nfind that nitrogen, the dominant atmospheric component, remains stable, while\nwater vapor is efficiently removed, a result inconsistent with equilibrium\nchemistry assumptions. Moreover, we compare our simulation results with laser\nexperiments and find good agreement in chemical yields.

We focus on the cases with bound post-explosion orbits, where the\nneutron star may periodically gravitationally capture gas from the companion.\nWe find that neutron star accretion must occur if the pre-supernova binary\nseparation is less than about 20 Rsun. This is because the stellar radius\nexpands beyond this radius before the shock-inflated envelope undergoes\nKelvin-Helmholtz contraction back to the main sequence. We then consider the\ninternal shocks formed between adjacent episodes of disk wind. The shocks\nefficiently convert the wind kinetic energy into radiation (due to\ninverse-Compton cooling), which heats up the supernova ejecta located at much\nlarger radii. The extra heating powers bright optical emission that is\nperiodically modulated on the orbital timescale. The shocks also accelerate\nnon-thermal particles which produce gamma-ray and neutrino emission from 100\nMeV to 10 PeV via hardronic pp collisions. The high-energy photons leak out of\nthe supernova ejecta after a delay of several months to one year.\nPhoto-ionization of the slowest parts of the disk wind produces hydrogen\nrecombination lines.

Starting with Harris\nsheet configuration, we study time evolution of reconnection rate and the\nAlfven four Mach number for outflow. These measurements validate the\nSweet-Parker scaling, consistent with previous studies. To study energy\nconversion processes, we calculate Ohmic dissipation, crucial for understanding\nhow energy is converted between plasma and electromagnetic fields. Decomposing\nelectric field components relative to velocity field, we find that energy\nconversion is initially dominated by the resistive electric field, but\nconvective electric fields take over as reconnection progresses. Plasma\nprimarily gains energy within the current sheet and near the separatrix. We\nperform a scan of magnetization for mildly relativistic plasma to examine\nscaling laws previously derived for non-relativistic inflow. We find the inflow\nis slower than predicted, due to conversion of magnetic energy mostly into\nthermal energy, causing strong compressibility. We calculate and verify the\nscaling of the compressibility factor, providing a more accurate representation\nof inflow dynamics. We analyze the impact of a guide field on reconnection and\nenergy partition, finding that a stronger guide field reduces the reconnection\nrate but has minimal effect on the relative distribution of kinetic, magnetic,\nand thermal energy.

The\ninfluences of turbulence spreading and symmetry breaking on edge shear flow\nwith sawtooth crashes are observed in the J-TEXT tokamak. The edge plasma\nturbulence and shear flow are measured using a fast reciprocating electrostatic\nprobe array. After sawtooth crashes, the heat and turbulence pulses in the core\npropagate to the edge, with the turbulence pulse being faster than the heat\npulse. After sawtooth crashes, the edge electron temperature increases and the\nedge turbulence is enhanced, with turbulence preceding temperature. The\nenhanced edge turbulence is mainly composed of two parts: the turbulence driven\nby local gradient and the turbulence spreading from core to edge. The\ndevelopment of the estimated turbulence spreading rate is prior to that of the\nturbulence driving rate. The increase in the turbulence intensity can cause the\nturbulent Reynold stress and its gradient to increase, thereby enhancing shear\nflows and radial electric fields. Turbulence spreading leads the edge Reynolds\nstresses to develop and the shear flow to be faster than edge electron\ntemperature. The Reynolds stress arises from the symmetry breaking of the\nturbulence wave number spectrum. After sawtooth collapses, the joint\nprobability density function of radial wave number and poloidal wave number of\nturbulence intensity exhibits strong asymmetry.

The simulations\ninvolve the vertical propagation of fast magneto-acoustic waves from the top of\nthe photosphere through the chromosphere. The model atmosphere is vertically\nstratified, including a horizontal, homogeneous magnetic field. We also apply\nthe linear theory to supplement the numerical results. Finally, we look at the\nassumptions of the 1F model to find out what causes the model discrepancies.\nResults: The results show that the temperature increase for the 1F model is\nslightly higher than for the 2F model, especially with long-period waves. The\nwave energy flux indicates that in the 2F model, the wave is transporting less\nenergy upwards. From the linear theory, we find that the wave in the 2F model\nloses more energy than in the 1F model in the deep layers, but the opposite\noccurs in the high layers. Conclusions: The efficient dissipation in the 2F\nmodel in deep layers reduces the energy flux at the high layers, reducing\nheating and explaining the temperature differences between models. We attribute\nthose discrepancies to the contribution of pressure forces to the drift\nvelocity and the omission of a term related to the centre of mass frame\nreference in the 1F energy equation.}",

In regions where the magnetic field is\nquasi-parallel to the plasma-vacuum boundary normal, plasma refills the wake\nprimarily along magnetic field lines. As faster electrons outpace slower ions,\nan ambipolar electric field is generated, accelerating ions and decelerating\nelectrons. Recent particle-in-cell simulations have shown that when accelerated\nsupersonic ion beams from opposite sides of the wake meet near the wake center,\nelectrostatic shocks may form, decelerating ions and heating electrons into\nflat-top velocity distributions. Using data from the Acceleration,\nReconnection, Turbulence and Electrodynamics of the Moon's Interaction with the\nSun (ARTEMIS) spacecraft, we present the first observational evidence of the\npredicted electrostatic shocks. Near the wake center of one event, we observed\nan electrostatic solitary structure with an amplitude of ~2 mV/m and a spatial\nscale of ~50 local Debye lengths. This structure generated a potential increase\nof ~50 V from upstream to downstream, heating incoming electrons by ~50 eV in\nthe parallel direction while decelerating ions by ~60 km/s leading to a density\nenhancement. At a second event representing a more evolved stage, we observed\nmore dissipated structures dominated by strong electrostatic waves, with\npersistent potential increases driving continued field-aligned electron heating\nand ion deceleration. These observations confirm simulation predictions of\nelectrostatic shock formation and the associated particle dynamics within the\nlunar wake, with potential applications to understanding plasma interactions\naround other airless celestial bodies.",

However, accurately\nforecasting iceberg trajectories remains a formidable challenge, primarily due\nto the scarcity of spatiotemporal data and the complex, nonlinear nature of\niceberg motion, which is also impacted by environmental variables. The iceberg\nmotion is influenced by multiple dynamic environmental factors, creating a\nhighly variable system that makes trajectory identification complex. These\nlimitations hinder the ability of deep learning models to effectively capture\nthe underlying dynamics and provide reliable predictive outcomes. To address\nthese challenges, we propose a hybrid IDRIFTNET model, a physics-driven deep\nlearning model that combines an analytical formulation of iceberg drift\nphysics, with an augmented residual learning model. The model learns the\npattern of mismatch between the analytical solution and ground-truth\nobservations, which is combined with a rotate-augmented spectral neural network\nthat captures both global and local patterns from the data to forecast future\niceberg drift positions.

The prototypical dwarf planet is Pluto, which for decades was regarded as a planet before the \"dwarf\" concept was adopted in 2006.\nMany planetary geologists consider dwarf planets and planetary-mass moons to be planets, but since 2006 the IAU and many astronomers have excluded them from the roster of planets.\nDwarf planets are capable of being geologically active, an expectation that was borne out in 2015 by the Dawn mission to Ceres and the New Horizons mission to Pluto. Planetary geologists are therefore particularly interested in them.\nAstronomers are in general agreement that at least the nine largest candidates are dwarf planets – in rough order of decreasing diameter, Pluto, Eris, Haumea, Makemake, Gonggong, Quaoar, Sedna, Ceres, and Orcus. A considerable uncertainty remains over the tenth largest candidate Salacia, which may thus be considered a borderline case. Of these ten, two have been visited by spacecraft (Pluto and Ceres) and seven others have at least one known moon (Eris, Haumea, Makemake, Gonggong, Quaoar, Orcus, and Salacia), which allows their masses and thus an estimate of their densities to be determined. Mass and density in turn can be fit into geophysical models in an attempt to determine the nature of these worlds. Only one, Sedna, has neither been visited nor has any known moons, making an accurate estimate of mass difficult. Some astronomers include many smaller bodies as well, but there is no consensus that these are likely to be dwarf planets.",

The angular\nresolution achieved for these observations ranged from 0.09-0.24 arcseconds,\ncorresponding to ~420-1100 km at Callisto. Global surface properties were\nderived from the observations using a thermophysical model (de Kleer et al.\n2021) constrained by spacecraft data. We find that Callisto's millimeter\nemissivities are high, with representative values of 0.85-0.97, compared to\n0.75-0.85 for Europa and Ganymede at these wavelengths. It is clear that models\nparameterized by a single thermal inertia are not sufficient to model\nCallisto's thermal emission, and clearly deviate from the temperature\ndistributions in the data in systematic ways. Rather, more complex models that\nadopt either two thermal inertia components or that treat electrical skin depth\nas a free parameter fit the data more accurately than single thermal inertia\nmodels.

Johnson, by an act of the United States Senate on February 19, 1973.\nJSC consists of a complex of 100 buildings constructed on 1,620 acres (660 ha) in Clear Lake. The center is home to NASA's astronaut corps, and is responsible for training astronauts from both the U.S. and its international partners. It also houses the Christopher C.

The STG was based at the Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, but reported organizationally to the Goddard Space Flight Center just outside Washington, D.C.

Due to\nthe non-spherical geometry of such bodies, their gravitational potential is\ndisturbed relative to a central field. By considering the body as a polyhedron\nand decomposing it into tetrahedral elements, we use the Series Potential\nExpansion Method (PSEM) to approximate the total potential by summing the\npotentials of each tetrahedron. While this model does not offer higher accuracy\nthan the classical polyhedral approach, it achieves relative errors below 0.1\\%\nfor points outside the body when developed to higher orders (e.g., orders 11\nand 12), and significantly reduces execution time. To validate this approach,\nwe apply our model to asteroids (87) Sylvia, (101955) Bennu, (99942) Apophis,\nand (25143) Itokawa.

      "content": "Aims. Quasar catalogues from narrow-band photometric data are used in a\nvariety of applications, including targeting for spectroscopic follow-up,\nmeasurements of supermassive black hole masses, or Baryon Acoustic\nOscillations. Here, we present the final quasar catalogue, including redshift\nestimates, from the miniJPAS Data Release constructed using several flavours of\nmachine-learning algorithms. Methods. In this work, we use a machine learning\nalgorithm to classify quasars, optimally combining the output of 8 individual\nalgorithms. We assess the relative importance of the different classifiers. We\ninclude results from 3 different redshift estimators to also provide improved\nphotometric redshifts. We compare our final catalogue against both simulated\ndata and real spectroscopic data. Our main comparison metric is the $f_1$\nscore, which balances the catalogue purity and completeness. Results. We\nevaluate the performance of the combined algorithm using synthetic data. In\nthis scenario, the combined algorithm outperforms the rest of the codes,\nreaching $f_1=0.88$ and $f_1=0.79$ for high- and low-z quasars (with $z\\geq2.1$\nand $z<2.1$, respectively) down to magnitude $r=23.5$. We further evaluate its\nperformance against real spectroscopic data, finding different performances. We\nconclude that our simulated data is not realistic enough and that a new version\nof the mocks would improve the performance. Our redshift estimates on mocks\nsuggest a typical uncertainty of $\\sigma_{\\rm NMAD} =0.11$, which, according to\nour results with real data, could be significantly smaller (as low as\n$\\sigma_{\\rm NMAD}=0.02$). We note that the data sample is still not large\nenough for a full statistical consideration.",

      "content": "We present a comprehensive Eulerian (Hamiltonian) framework for relativistic\nfluid dynamics in curved spacetimes, with emphasis on Schwarzschild geometry.\nThe key innovation lies in the consistent use of density and three-velocity\nfields, all defined in coordinate (Newtonian) time, while fully incorporating\nrelativistic and curvature effects. {\\it We stress that the entire dynamics is\ndeveloped in coordinate (Eulerian) time, from the viewpoint of a static\nEulerian observer.} In the non-relativistic regime, it is well known that\nPoisson brackets between the density $\\rho(\\vec{x}, t)$ and velocity fields\n$v^i(\\vec{x}, t)$, together with an appropriate Hamiltonian, yield the\ncontinuity and Euler equations as Hamiltonian equations of motion. These\nfield-theoretic Poisson brackets can be derived from canonical phase-space\nbrackets defined on Lagrangian variables $(x_i, p_j)$, mapped to Eulerian\nfields $(\\rho, v^i)$. We extend this framework to curved spacetime by\nconstructing a relativistic version of the Eulerian Poisson algebra and\nproposing a corresponding Hamiltonian. This yields relativistic continuity and\nEuler equations valid in generic spacetimes, with evolution in coordinate time.\nApplying this to the Schwarzschild metric, we obtain exact stationary\nbackground solutions for radial flows and perform a perturbative stability\nanalysis. We also introduce a generalised vorticity and examine its effect on\nperturbations over irrotational backgrounds, revealing its role in flow\nstability.

Understanding how the shape of cloud particle size distributions\naffects the atmospheric properties of sub-stellar atmospheres is a key area to\nexplore, particularly in the JWST era of broad wavelength coverage, where\nobservations are sensitive to particle size distributions. It is therefore\nimportant to elucidate how underlying cloud microphysical processes influence\nthe size distribution, in order to better understand how clouds affect observed\natmospheric properties. Aims. In this follow-up paper, we aim to extend our\nsub-stellar atmosphere microphysical cloud formation framework from Paper I to\ninclude effects of assuming a polydisperse gamma particle size distribution,\nrequiring a three-moment solution set of equations. Methods. We develop a\nthree-moment framework for sub-stellar mineral cloud particle microphysical\nnucleation, condensation, evaporation and collisional growth assuming a gamma\ndistribution. As in Paper I, we demonstrate the effects of polydispersity using\na simple one-dimensional Y-dwarf KCl cloud formation scenario, and compare the\nresults with the monodisperse case. Results. Our three-moment scheme provides a\ngeneralised framework applicable to any size distribution with a defined moment\ngeneration expression. In our test case, we show that the gamma distribution\nevolves with altitude, initially broad at the cloud base and narrowing at lower\npressures. We find that differences between the gamma and monodisperse cloud\nstructures can be significant, depending on the surface gravity of the\natmosphere. Conclusions.

      "content": "Recent developments in the study of pulsar radio emission revealed that the\nmicrophysics of quantum electrodynamic (QED) pair cascades at pulsar polar caps\nmay be responsible for generating the observed coherent radio waves. However,\nmodeling the pair cascades in the polar cap region poses significant\nchallenges, particularly under conditions of high plasma multiplicity.\nTraditional Particle-in-Cell (PIC) methods often face rapidly increasing\ncomputational costs as the multiplicity grows exponentially. To address this\nissue, we present a new simulation code using the Vlasov method, which\nefficiently simulates the evolution of charged particle distribution functions\nin phase space without a proportional increase in computational expense at high\nmultiplicities. We apply this code to study $e^\\pm$ pair cascades in 1D,\nincorporating key physical processes such as curvature radiation, radiative\ncooling, and magnetic pair production. We study both the Ruderman-Sutherland\n(RS) and the Space-charge-limited Flow (SCLF) regimes, and find quasiperiodic\ngap formation and pair production bursts in both cases. These features produce\nstrong electric field oscillations, potentially enabling coherent low-frequency\nradio emission. We construct a unified analytic model that describes the key\nfeatures of the polar cap cascade, which can be used to estimate the return\ncurrent heating rate that can be used to inform X-ray hotspot models. Spectral\nanalysis shows that a significant amount of energy is carried in superluminal\nmodes -- collective excitations that could connect to observed radio features.\nOur results align with previous PIC studies while offering enhanced fidelity in\nboth dense and rarefied regions.",

      "content": "Although interstellar dust extinction serves as a powerful distance\nestimator, the solar system's location within the Galactic plane complicates\ndistance determinations, especially for molecular clouds (MCs) at varying\ndistances along the line of sight (LoS). The presence of complex extinction\npatterns along LoS introduces degeneracies, resulting in less accurate distance\nmeasurements to overlapping MCs in crowded regions of the Galactic plane. In\nthis study, we develop the CUSUM-based Jump-point Analysis for Distance\nEstimation (CU-JADE), a novel method designed to help mitigate these\nobservational challenges. The key strengths of CU-JADE include: (1) sensitivity\nto detect abrupt jumps in $Distance$-$A_{\\lambda}$ ($D$-$A$) datasets, (2)\nminimal systematic errors as demonstrated on both mock and observed data, and\n(3) the ability to combine CUSUM analysis with multi-wavelength data to improve\nthe completeness of distance measurements for nearby gas structures, even for\nextinction values as low as $\\Delta A_{V} \\gtrsim 0.15$ mag. By combining CO\nsurvey data with a large sample of stars characterized by high-precision\nparallaxes and extinctions, we uncovered the multi-layered molecular gas\ndistribution in the high-latitude Cepheus region.

The scatter of\nthe DM as a function of redshift provides insight into the lumpiness of the\nelectron distribution and, consequently, baryonic feedback processes.

The spacecraft's Solar Wind Instrument Suite (SWIS) which includes three instruments will monitor solar wind, and the Compact Coronagraph (CCOR) will monitor the Sun's surroundings to image coronal mass ejection (CME). A CME is a large outburst of plasma sent from the Sun towards interplanetary space.\nTogether with space weather observation capabilities on the Earth-orbiting GOES-U satellite, SWFO-L1 constitutes the space segment of NOAA's Space Weather Follow On (SWFO) program.

Drawings typically contain multiple views of a component, although additional scratch views may be added of details for further explanation. Only the information that is a requirement is typically specified. Key information such as dimensions is usually only specified in one place on a drawing, avoiding redundancy and the possibility of inconsistency. Suitable tolerances are given for critical dimensions to allow the component to be manufactured and function.

The collected letters were given to the GCA Corp in Burlington MA which used a reduction camera to make a negative photomask containing all the letters plus an inscription around its edge at its final size. This mask was given to Sprague Electric Company of North Adams, Massachusetts which imaged it onto a silicon wafer and etched the pattern into the wafer. NASA head Thomas O. Paine proposed the idea to the U.S. State Department, and corresponded with world leaders to solicit their messages. These were enshrined by being photographed and reduced to 1/200 scale ultra microfiche silicon etching. The disc rests in an aluminum case on the Moon's Sea of Tranquility.\n\nThe disc was in a package in Buzz Aldrin's suit shoulder pocket along with some other memorial items. He was reminded about the package by Neil Armstrong while ascending the ladder of the Lunar Module Eagle to finish their EVA. He then dropped it to the surface. Later Houston requested and received confirmation they had placed it.",

      "content": "The recent detection of TeV neutrino sources by the IceCube Neutrino\nObservatory demonstrates the detector's advanced capabilities in detecting\nhigh-energy astrophysical neutrinos. At lower energies, down to the GeV range,\na variety of transient phenomena, such as novae, supernovae, and gamma-ray\nbursts, are expected to emit neutrinos. Observations of these neutrinos can\nprovide unique insights into processes below the photosphere and offer clues to\nidentifying their emission mechanisms. We have searched for these neutrinos\nintensively with IceCube's existing infill array, DeepCore. Although no\nsignificant detections have been made, strong constraints on astrophysical\nenvironments in these transients, such as the baryon loading factor in\ngamma-ray bursts, have been obtained. A denser infill array, called the IceCube\nUpgrade, will enhance sub-TeV neutrino searches with its unprecedented\nsensitivity to GeV neutrinos. The Upgrade, set to be deployed in the 2025-2026\nSouth Pole season, will consist of seven new strings, adding approximately 700\nnovel optical modules with multiple photomultiplier tubes in the DeepCore\nvolume. The denser arrangement of high-efficiency modules will significantly\nimprove IceCube's sensitivity between 1 GeV and 1 TeV. We present an initial\nassessment of the astrophysical capabilities of the IceCube Upgrade, using\npreliminary simulated data and an event selection similar to that used for\nDeepCore. We explore the detectability of GeV neutrino transients compared to\nDeepCore and discuss potential sensitivity enhancements through advanced\ndetector simulations and optimized analysis techniques, including refined\ntriggering conditions and event selection criteria.",

Accurate prediction of multipactor susceptibility across\ndifferent materials and operational regimes remains a critical yet\ncomputationally intensive challenge in accelerator component design and RF\nengineering. This study presents the first application of supervised machine\nlearning (ML) for predicting multipactor susceptibility in two-surface planar\ngeometries. A simulation-derived dataset spanning six distinct secondary\nelectron yield (SEY) material profiles is used to train regression models -\nincluding Random Forest (RF), Extra Trees (ET), Extreme Gradient Boosting\n(XGBoost), and funnel-structured Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) - to predict the\ntime-averaged electron growth rate, ${\\delta}_{avg}$.

Tree-based models consistently outperform MLPs\nin generalizing across disjoint material domains. MLPs trained using a\nscalarized objective function that combines IoU and SSIM during Bayesian\nhyperparameter optimization with 5-fold cross-validation outperform those\ntrained with single-objective loss functions. Principal Component Analysis\nreveals that performance degradation for certain materials stems from disjoint\nfeature-space distributions, underscoring the need for broader dataset\ncoverage.

First explored in the film Doctor Strange (2016), it is revisited in the film Avengers: Endgame (2019) before playing a key role in Phases Four, Five, and Six of the MCU, which constitute \"The Multiverse Saga\". The MCU's multiverse centers on a universe called the \"Sacred Timeline\". Initially, alternative universes were generally \"pruned\" by the Time Variance Authority (TVA), until Sylvie kills TVA's leader, \"He Who Remains\", allowing new universes to fully form. Following this, the TVA under new management instead nurtures and observes these new universes. Occasionally, some universes are considered separate from the \"Sacred Timeline\" but still monitored by the TVA.\nMany alternate versions of existing MCU characters have been introduced via the multiverse, most notably those of Loki, Kang the Conqueror, Spider-Man, Doctor Strange, Deadpool, and Wolverine. The main reality depicted in the MCU is designated Earth-616 beginning with the film Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (2022), despite its original designation as Earth-199999 by Marvel Comics and outside media. The multiverse has received a mixed response from critics, with praise for its visuals and nostalgic appeal but criticism of its excessive reliance on fan service. The incorporation of characters from non-MCU Marvel films were featured in the films Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021) and Deadpool & Wolverine (2024) which has also generated speculation and discussion among viewers and commentators.",

The most notable claim of these conspiracy theories is that the six crewed landings (1969–1972) were faked and that twelve Apollo astronauts did not actually land on the Moon. Various groups and individuals have made claims since the mid-1970s that NASA and others knowingly misled the public into believing the landings happened, by manufacturing, tampering with, or destroying evidence including photos, telemetry tapes, radio and TV transmissions, and Moon rock samples.\nMuch third-party evidence for the landings exists, and detailed rebuttals to the hoax claims have been made. Since the late 2000s, high-definition photos taken by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) of the Apollo landing sites have captured the Lunar Module descent stages and the tracks left by the astronauts. In 2012, images were released showing five of the six Apollo missions' American flags erected on the Moon still standing. The exception is that of Apollo 11, which has lain on the lunar surface since being blown over by the Lunar Module Ascent Propulsion System.\nReputable experts in science and astronomy regard the claims as pseudoscience and demonstrably false. Opinion polls taken in various locations between 1994 and 2009 have shown that between 6% and 20% of Americans, 25% of Britons, and 28% of Russians surveyed believe that the crewed landings were faked. Even as late as 2001, the Fox television network documentary Conspiracy Theory: Did We Land on the Moon? claimed NASA faked the first landing in 1969 to win the Space Race.",

How much of this complexity endures to the planet\nformation stage, and thus is already present when planets form, remains largely\nunknown. Here we report Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA)\nobservations in which we tentatively detect EG and GN in the protoplanetary\ndisk around the outbursting protostar V883 Ori.

Observations onboard Parker Solar Probe (PSP) at\nheliocentric distances below 50 Solar Radii (Rs) showed that within SBs,\nperturbations in the magnetic field ({\\Delta}B) and the bulk solar wind\nvelocity ({\\Delta}V) align, i.e., {\\Delta}B~{\\Delta}V, producing enhanced\nradial velocity spikes.

The results indicate that SB boundaries can be unstable\nfor generating KHI-driven surface waves, suggesting that the wave activity\nobserved at SB boundaries is caused by shear flow instabilities. In addition,\nthe continued development of KHI may lead to boundary erosion, contributing to\nthe radial evolution of SBs via structural weakening or broadening. However,\nwhen {\\Delta}B and {\\Delta}V are closely aligned, the boundary remains stable\nunless the velocity shear significantly exceeds the magnetic shear. Since the\nobserved velocity shear typically ranges from 40% to 90% of magnetic shear, the\ninstability condition is generally not satisfied. Thus, the configuration\nleading to the instability arises from deviations from precise alignment of\n{\\Delta}B and {\\Delta}V in the young solar wind, and the release of the KHI\npresumably leads to the formation of the {\\Delta}B and {\\Delta}V alignment\nobserved at SB boundaries located at 35-55 Rs.",

      "content": "Supernova neutrinos are weakly interactive elementary particles produced during a core-collapse supernova explosion. A massive star collapses at the end of its life, emitting on the order of 1058 neutrinos and antineutrinos in all lepton flavors. The luminosity of different neutrino and antineutrino species are roughly the same. They carry away about 99% of the gravitational energy of the dying star as a burst lasting tens of seconds. The typical supernova neutrino energies are 10 to 20 MeV. Supernovae are considered the strongest and most frequent source of cosmic neutrinos in the MeV energy range.\nSince neutrinos are generated in the core of a supernova, they play a crucial role in the star's collapse and explosion. Neutrino heating is believed to be a critical factor in supernova explosions. Therefore, observation of neutrinos from supernovae provides detailed information about core collapse and the explosion mechanism. Further, neutrinos undergoing collective flavor conversions in a supernova's dense interior offers opportunities to study neutrino-neutrino interactions. The only supernova neutrino event detected so far is SN 1987A. Nevertheless, with current detector sensitivities, it is expected that thousands of neutrino events from a galactic core-collapse supernova would be observed. The next generation of experiments are designed to be sensitive to neutrinos from supernova explosions as far as Andromeda or beyond. The observation of supernovae will broaden our understanding of various astrophysical and particle physics phenomena. Further, coincident detection of supernova neutrino in different experiments would provide an early alarm to astronomers about a supernova.",

When the original object enters the atmosphere, various factors such as friction, pressure, and chemical interactions with the atmospheric gases cause it to heat up and radiate energy. It then becomes a meteor and forms a fireball, also known as a shooting star; astronomers call the brightest examples \"bolides\". Once it settles on the larger body's surface, the meteor becomes a meteorite. Meteorites vary greatly in size. For geologists, a bolide is a meteorite large enough to create an impact crater.\nMeteorites that are recovered after being observed as they transit the atmosphere and impact Earth are called meteorite falls. All others are known as meteorite finds. Meteorites have traditionally been divided into three broad categories: stony meteorites that are rocks, mainly composed of silicate minerals; iron meteorites that are largely composed of ferronickel; and stony-iron meteorites that contain large amounts of both metallic and rocky material. Modern classification schemes divide meteorites into groups according to their structure, chemical and isotopic composition and mineralogy. \"Meteorites\" less than ~1 mm (3⁄64 inch) in diameter are classified as micrometeorites, however micrometeorites differ from meteorites in that they typically melt completely in the atmosphere and fall to Earth as quenched droplets. Extraterrestrial meteorites have been found on the Moon and on Mars.\nMost space rocks crashing into Earth come from a single source. The origin of most meteorites can be traced to just a handful of asteroid breakup events – and possibly even individual asteroids.",

Here, for the first\ntime, we provide variations of magnetic field and plasma-$\\beta$ along\nmagnetically structured loops from the photosphere to the corona. We have\nselected several fan loops rooted in sunspot umbra observed simultaneously by\nthe Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph and Solar Dynamics Observatory. The\n3-min slow waves enabled us to trace and analyze several fan loops with\ncross-sectional areas in the lower atmosphere and locate their footpoints at\nthe photosphere. We find the RMS magnetic field strengths in the range\n1596-2269 G at the photospheric footpoints of the fan loops, which decrease\nrapidly to 158-236 G at the coronal footpoints. We estimated the plasma-$\\beta$\nat the photospheric and coronal footpoints in the range 0.2-0.5 and\n0.0001-0.001, respectively. We found plasma-$\\beta$$<$$1$ along the whole loop,\nwhereas the plasma-$\\beta$$\\approx$$1$ layer is found to be at sub-photospheric\nheights. We compared our findings for isolated individual fan loops with a\npreviously established model for active regions and found an almost similar\npattern in variations with height, but with different plasma-$\\beta$ values.\nOur results demonstrate the seismological potential of 3-min slow waves\nomnipresent in the umbral sunspot atmosphere to probe and map isolated loops\nand determine magnetic field and plasma-$\\beta$ along these loops.

Open questions remain about plume formation, including the role of\nsmall-scale transients and whether plumes embedded in different magnetic field\nconfigurations have similar formation mechanisms. We report on coordinated\nSolar Orbiter/Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI), Interface Region Imaging\nSpectrograph, and Solar Dynamics Observatory observations of the formation of a\nplume in sunspot penumbra in 2022 March. During this observation, Solar Orbiter\nwas positioned near the Earth-Sun line and EUI observed at a 5 s cadence with a\nspatial scale of 185 km pixel$^{-1}$ in the solar corona. We observe fine-scale\ndots at various locations in the sunspot, but the brightest and highest density\nof dots is at the plume base. Space-time maps along the plume axis show\nparabolic and V-shaped patterns, and we conclude that some of these dots are\npossible signatures of magneto-acoustic shocks.

Leveraging a four-dimensional ensemble variational (4DEnVar)\napproach and an Ensemble of Data Assimilations (EDA), we demonstrate a novel\ncapability to assimilate hourly NO2 retrievals from TEMPO alongside\npolar-orbiting TROPOMI data into NASA's GEOS Composition Forecast (GEOS-CF)\nmodel. The system is evaluated over the CONUS region for August 2023, using a\nsuite of independent measurements including Pandora spectrometers, AirNow\nsurface stations, and aircraft-based observations from AEROMMA and STAQS field\ncampaigns. Results show that the assimilation system successfully integrates\ngeostationary NO2 observations, improves model performance in the column, and\ncaptures diurnal variability. However, assimilation also leads to systematic\nreductions in surface NO2 levels, improving agreement with some datasets (e.g.,\nPandora, AEROMMA) but degrading comparisons with others (e.g., AirNow). These\nfindings highlight the importance of joint evaluation across platforms and\nmotivate further development of dual-concentration emission assimilation\nschemes.

Application to previous models that assume either a\npower-law or exponential mass deposition allows a direct comparison of their\nvelocity solutions. We then obtain solutions for new models that have mass\ndepositions with a gaussian or the empirically motivated forms derived by\nPlummer and Elson. Comparisons show that, when cast in terms of the radius\nscaled by the critical radius, the overall velocity laws are all quite similar,\nasymptotically approaching the energy-averaged stellar wind speed $V_w$, and\nanchored to passing through a common critical/sonic speed $v_c = V_w/2$. By\nderiving associated variations in outflow density and temperature, we obtain\nscaling forms for the expected X-ray emission, and show that radiative cooling\ngenerally represents only a small correction to the assumed cooling from\nadiabatic expansion. An initial analysis of incomplete wind thermalization\nsuggests this should likewise have modest effect on the overall outflow in\ndense clusters.

      "content": "Spacecraft electric propulsion (or just electric propulsion) is a type of spacecraft propulsion technique that uses electrostatic or electromagnetic fields to accelerate mass to high speed and thus generating thrust to modify the velocity of a spacecraft in orbit. The propulsion system is controlled by power electronics.\nElectric thrusters typically use much less propellant than chemical rockets because they have a higher exhaust speed (operate at a higher specific impulse) than chemical rockets. Due to limited electric power the thrust is much weaker compared to chemical rockets, but electric propulsion can provide thrust for a longer time.\nElectric propulsion was first demonstrated in the 1960s and is now a mature and widely used technology on spacecraft. American and Russian satellites have used electric propulsion for decades. As of 2019, over 500 spacecraft operated throughout the Solar System use electric propulsion for station keeping, orbit raising, or primary propulsion. In the future, the most advanced electric thrusters may be able to impart a delta-v of 100 km/s (62 mi/s), which is enough to take a spacecraft to the outer planets of the Solar System (with nuclear power), but is insufficient for interstellar travel. An electric rocket with an external power source (transmissible through laser on the photovoltaic panels) has a theoretical possibility for interstellar flight. However, electric propulsion is not suitable for launches from the Earth's surface, as it offers too little thrust.\nOn a journey to Mars, an electrically powered ship might be able to carry 70% of its initial mass to the destination, while a chemical rocket could carry only a few percent.",

While the rest-NIR surface brightness profiles of the\n1.1mm-selected galaxies are brighter in the inner regions relative to the field\nstar-forming population, they are remarkably similar to the quiescent\npopulation. These morphological differences could suggest that dusty\nstar-forming galaxies, unlike more typical star-forming galaxies, have already\nbuilt up stellar mass in a severely dust-obscured core, leading to extended and\nclumpy morphologies at rest-optical wavelengths and more compact emission in\nthe rest-NIR that is co-spatial with dust.

The Wang-Sheeley-Arge (WSA) model has been a workhorse model\nthat provides the near-Sun SW conditions. An important component of it is the\nPotential Field Source Surface (PFSS) model. This study analyzes 15 different\nCarrington Rotations(CRs), and presents detailed analysis of CR 2052 to\nidentify WSA model settings that lead to successful and erroneous SW\npredictions at Earth. For the events studied, we show that increasing the\nmodels grid resolution improves the open-close boundary identification.

In addition, we find an optimized source surface height (R$_{ss}$)\n(lying between 1.8-3.1 R$_{\\odot}$) further enhances HSS prediction accuracy\nfor the studied events. A detailed analysis shows that changes in R$_{ss}$, (a)\nchanges the Great Circle Angular Distance (GCAD) maps (at the solar surface) of\nthe associated coronal holes and (b) changes the foot-point locations of the\nmagnetic connectivities to the sub-Earth locations. These factors change the\nnear-Sun SW speed, that eventually leads to uncertainties in speeds near Earth.\nWe also investigate the usefulness of coronal hole observations in constraining\nR$_{ss}$ and SW solutions at Earth, and highlight their underutilized value in\nguiding the selection of magnetic maps for improved ambient solar wind modeling\nat L1.",

The error sensitivity shows a\nphysically consistent influence of upstream weather dynamics and sea surface\ntemperatures on forecast accuracy. The latter also highlights the importance of\naccurately representing the atmosphere--ocean coupling in numerical weather\nprediction models. This combined approach could provide valuable heuristics for\ndiagnosing neural model errors and guiding targeted model improvements.",

      "content": "Moonrise Kingdom is a 2012 American coming-of-age comedy-drama film directed by Wes Anderson, written by Anderson and Roman Coppola, and starring Bruce Willis, Edward Norton, Bill Murray, Frances McDormand, Tilda Swinton, Jason Schwartzman, Bob Balaban, and introducing Jared Gilman and Kara Hayward. Largely set on the fictional island of New Penzance somewhere off the coast of New England, it tells the story of an orphan boy (Gilman) who escapes from a scouting camp to unite with his pen pal and love interest, a girl with aggressive tendencies (Hayward). Feeling alienated from their guardians and shunned by their peers, the lovers abscond to an isolated beach. Meanwhile, the island's police captain (Willis) organizes a search party of scouts and family members to locate the runaways.\nIn crafting their screenplay, Anderson and Coppola drew from personal experiences and memories of childhood fantasies as well as films including Melody (1971) and The 400 Blows (1959). Auditions for child actors took eight months, and filming took place in Rhode Island over three months in 2011.\nMoonrise Kingdom premiered at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival and received critical acclaim, with its themes of young love, child sexuality, juvenile mental health, and the Genesis flood narrative being praised. Critics cited the film's color palette and use of visual symmetry as well as the use of original composition by Alexandre Desplat to supplement existing music by Benjamin Britten. It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay and the Golden Globe for Best Musical or Comedy. In 2016, the BBC included the film in its list of greatest films of the twenty-first century.",

      "content": "We present Compressible Atmospheric Model-Network (CAM-NET), an AI model\ndesigned to predict neutral atmospheric variables from the Earth's surface to\nthe ionosphere with high accuracy and computational efficiency. Accurate\nmodeling of the entire atmosphere is critical for understanding the upward\npropagation of gravity waves, which influence upper-atmospheric dynamics and\ncoupling across atmospheric layers. CAM-NET leverages the Spherical Fourier\nNeural Operator (SFNO) to capture global-scale atmospheric dynamics while\npreserving the Earth's spherical structure. Trained on a decade of datasets\nfrom the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model with thermosphere and\nionosphere eXtension (WACCM-X), CAM-NET demonstrates accuracy comparable to\nWACCM-X while achieving a speedup of over 1000x in inference time, can provide\none year simulation within a few minutes once trained. The model effectively\npredicts key atmospheric parameters, including zonal and meridional winds,\ntemperature, and time rate of pressure. Inspired by traditional modeling\napproaches that use external couplers to simulate tracer transport, CAM-NET\nintroduces a modular architecture that explicitly separates tracer prediction\nfrom core dynamics. The core backbone of CAM-NET focuses on forecasting primary\nphysical variables (e.g., temperature, wind velocity), while tracer variables\nare predicted through a lightweight, fine-tuned model. This design allows for\nefficient adaptation to specific tracer scenarios with minimal computational\ncost, avoiding the need to retrain the entire model. We have validated this\napproach on the $O^2$ tracer, demonstrating strong performance and\ngeneralization capabilities.",

This study presents\na combined approach using Liouville mapping and the field-particle correlation\ntechnique to investigate qualitatively and quantitatively the velocity-space\nsignature of ion cyclotron damping. Liouville mapping offers a computationally\nefficient way to predict perturbations to the particle velocity distribution\nfunction using single-particle trajectories in prescribed electromagnetic\nfields. One may apply the field-particle correlation technique to these\nperturbed velocity distributions to reveal the unique velocity-space signatures\nof the secular energy transfer rate associated with specific wave-particle\ninteractions. We validate this method by reproducing known Landau damping\nsignatures for kinetic Alfv\\'en waves, and then we apply this method to ion\ncyclotron waves where ion cyclotron damping dominates. The resulting\nvelocity-space signature reveals distinct energization features of ion\ncyclotron damping : (i) a quadrupolar pattern in the perpendicular $(v_x, v_y)$\nplane; and (ii) a localized energization near the $n = 1$ resonant velocity in\ngyrotropic $(v_\\parallel, v_\\perp)$ velocity-space. The quantitative patterns\nremain unchanged as the ion plasma beta $\\beta_i$ is varied, ultimately showing\nminimal $v_\\perp$ dependence on $\\beta_i$ of the velocity-space signature at\nthe $n = 1$ resonant velocity.

In this work, we analytically revisit the direct correlation of\nforeground-filtered line intensity mapping with CMB lensing, highlighting\nlightcone evolution's previously neglected yet unavoidable and crucial effects.\nIndeed, the growth of structure and evolution of line emission along the\nlightcone breaks statistical translational invariance and thus induces mode\ncoupling, even in linear theory, which enables the recovery of the smoothly\nvarying modes lost to bright foregrounds. We compute the effects of these\nlightcone evolution-induced mode couplings on the LIMxCMB lensing\ncross-spectrum detectability, predicting that future wider-sky versions of\nCOMAP, CCAT, and HETDEX will be able to precisely measure this\ncross-correlation.

This study presents the\nfirst dedicated economic assessment of geomagnetic storm impacts on Aotearoa\nNew Zealand, quantifying potential GDP losses across seven disruption and\nmitigation scenarios due to an extreme coronal mass ejection (CME). The primary\nfocus is upon the damaging impacts of geomagnetically induced currents (GICs)\non the electrical power transmission network. The goal is to support\ndecision-making around space weather mitigation investments by providing a\nfirst-order approximation of their potential economic benefits. We find that in\nthe absence of mitigation, a severe but realistic storm could result in up to\nNZ\\$8.36 billion in lost GDP, with more than half stemming from cascading\nsupply chain effects.

We conducted model experiments for northern summer\nsolstice conditions, first including only tropospheric sources, then including\nsources localized at 50 and 90 km, and uniformly distributed over all heights.\nThe simulated differences in mean temperature and horizontal winds demonstrate\nthat gravity waves produce the greatest dynamical and thermal changes in the\nlatter case compared to the localized sources. While the gravity wave drag is\nlongitudinally uniform in the lower thermosphere, it is more localized in the\nupper thermosphere in all the simulations. Waves from uniformly distributed\nsources increase the longitudinal variability of zonal winds in the\nthermosphere up to $\\sim$150 km. Gravity wave effects exhibit different local\ntime variations in the lower thermosphere (100--140 km) than in the upper\nthermosphere. In the upper thermosphere, gravity wave effects are stronger\nduring the day than at night. In contrast, nighttime gravity wave effects are\nstronger than the daytime ones in the lower thermosphere. Finally, a comparison\nwith ICON-MIGHTI observations shows that the model reproduces the basic\nstructure of thermospheric winds, performing better with zonal winds than with\nmeridional winds.

Saturn has a pale yellow hue, due to ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere. An electrical current in the metallic hydrogen layer is thought to give rise to Saturn's planetary magnetic field, which is weaker than Earth's, but has a magnetic moment 580 times that of Earth because of Saturn's greater size. Saturn's magnetic field strength is about a twentieth that of Jupiter. The outer atmosphere is generally bland and lacking in contrast, although long-lived features can appear.

Blige, whose version of the song leaked online in 2011.\n\"Titanium\" is a pop song which draws from the genres of house and urban-dance. The song's lyrics are about inner strength. Critics were positive towards the song and noted it as one of the standout tracks from Nothing but the Beat. Sia's vocals received comparisons to those of Fergie and the song was also musically compared to Coldplay's work. \"Titanium\" attained top 10 positions in several major music markets, including Australia, Austria, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Philippines, Thailand, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United States. In the United Kingdom, it peaked at number one, becoming Guetta's fifth number-one single on the chart and Sia's first.\nThe song's accompanying music video premiered on 20 December 2011 but does not feature appearances by Guetta or Sia, instead it focuses on a young boy with supernatural powers, played by actor Ryan Lee. On 12 August 2012, the music video was reused for a Spanish language version of the song.",

We present highlights for the Euclid\nscientific capability to test initial conditions beyond LCDM with the main\nprobes, i.e. 3D galaxy clustering from the spectroscopic survey, the\ntomographic approach to 3x2pt statistics from photometric galaxy survey, and\ntheir combination. We provide Fisher forecasts from the combination of Euclid\nspectroscopic and photometric surveys for spatial curvature, running of the\nspectral index of the power spectrum of curvature perturbations, isocurvature\nperturbations, and primordial features. For the parameters of these models we\nalso provide the combination of Euclid forecasts (pessimistic and optimistic)\nwith current and future measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB)\nanisotropies., i.e. Planck, the Simons Observatory (SO), and CMB-S4. We provide\nFisher forecasts for how the power spectrum and bispectrum from the Euclid\nspectroscopic survey will constrain the local, equilateral, and orthogonal\nshapes of primordial non-Gaussianity. We also review how Bayesian field-level\ninference of primordial non-Gaussianity can constrain local primordial\nnon-Gaussianity. We show how Euclid, with its unique combination of the main\nprobes, will provide the tightest constraints on low redshift to date. By\ntargeting a markedly different range in redshift and scale, Euclid's expected\nuncertainties are complementary to those obtained by CMB primary anisotropy,\nreturning the tightest combined constraints on the physics of the early\nUniverse.",

      "content": "The aim of the paper is to demonstrate that electron current oscillations may\ngenerate electromagnetic waves as type III radiation and whistler waves without\nthe involvement of the classical plasma emission via the coalescence of waves.\nPIC simulation results of an electron-core-strahl plasma without initial\ncurrent compensation are presented which describe the conversion of\ncurrent-driven Langmuir oscillations/waves into type III radiation whereby\nsimultaneously whistler waves are excited. In contrast to the classical\napproach of Ginzburg and Zhelezniakov (1958) after which beam-excited Langmuir\nwaves in a two-step process are converted in electromagnetic radiation, any\ninstability is suppressed by selecting a low strahl velocity. Rather electric\nfield oscillations at the electron plasma frequency are triggered by the\ninitially non-compensated current of the strahl. The arising electromagnetic\nfields exhibit amplitude oscillations which are caused by the superposition of\nthe two wave modes of mixed polarisation at the point of mode coupling. This\nbasic mechanism of wave generation and transformation has already been\ndescribed in earlier papers using simple fluid models. It is also the topic of\nthe companion paper. Besides the fundamental electromagnetic radiation, the\nsecond harmonic of nearly the same intensity has been obtained which is an\nindication for nonlinear currents. Measurements of Langmuir waves, type III\nradiation and whistler waves on board various satellites in the solar wind, in\nparticular Parker Solar Probe (PSP) observations are analysed in the light of\nour results. Interpretations of earlier PIC simulations are critically\nreviewed.",

      "content": "The Parker Solar Probe (PSP) mission has revealed frequent occurrences of\nswitchbacks (SBs) and small-scale magnetic flux ropes (SMFRs) as prominent\nstructures within the solar wind. These mesoscale features are observed across\nall heliocentric distances, with heightened activity in the young solar wind,\nsuch as successive SMFRs, blobs, and SBs using PSP in situ observations. One\nstudy, in particular, focuses on SMFRs observed during the intervals of PSP\nco-rotating with the Sun, which suggests a similar source of the observed solar\nwind. In this letter, we identified SBs at the boundaries of SMFRs as a\nregularly observed phenomenon and found instances where SBs and SMFRs co-occur,\nwith the significance level $\\alpha<0.05$. The SMFR-related SBs - observed at\nthe leading and trailing edges of an SMFR - exhibit well-organized axial\nco-orientations, with their polarity flipping, meaning the radial direction\nremains constrained while the transversal field reverses. Furthermore, the\naxial field directions of SMFRs-related SBs appear to be more closely connected\nthan to another SB that is spatially closer and are linked to the SMFR\norientation. Our analysis of their relative geometry, which examines the\nalignment between SBs and the SMFR axis, reveals a distinct tendency\nemphasizing their correlation, further supporting the idea that the axes of\nSMFR-related SBs are presumably determined by the SMFR orientation.\nObservations suggest that a fraction of SBs is spatially and temporally\nassociated with SMFRs, implying that processes related to SMFR boundaries may\ncontribute to SB formation, or that SBs tend to develop in magnetic\nenvironments shaped by SMFRs.",

Similarly, GRB\n150101B displayed remarkable similarities to GRB 170817A, further supporting\nits association with compact binary mergers. The objective of this study is to\nuncover the intrinsic properties that differentiate merger-associated sGRBs\nfrom other GRBs by analyzing the Fermi GBM Burst Catalog and using GRB 170817A\nand GRB 150101B as reference events, enhancing our ability to select events\nfrom this class and promptly to search for their electromagnetic counterpart.\nWe employed a clustering technique to classify GRBs based on their observed\nproperties in gamma-rays (T90, Epeak and fluence). Prior to clustering, we\ntested three dimensionality reduction techniques, among which Uniform Manifold\nApproximation and Projection demonstrated the best performance making it the\npreferred technique for our analysis. This combination of dimensionality\nreduction and clustering analysis allowed us to group GRBs with similar\ncharacteristics, with a focus on identifying those most likely associated with\nBNS mergers.

To characterise the X-ray properties of EP J005146.9-730930 and in\nparticular to look for pulsations in the X-ray flux, we triggered an XMM-Newton\nanticipated target of opportunity observation. To follow the flux evolution\nduring the outburst we monitored the source for about three months with the\nFollow-up X-ray Telescope of EP. The XMM-Newton observation was performed on\n2024 September 15 and we used the data from the European Photon Imaging Camera\n(EPIC) for detailed spectral and timing analyses. The EPIC X-ray spectrum is\nwell described by an absorbed power law with photon index of 1.25 +/- 0.04 and\nthe timing analysis revealed pulsations with 146.79 +\\- 0.03 s. The source flux\nhad decreased by a factor of about 10 since the observed maximum about one\nmonth before the XMM-Newton observation. EP J005146.9-730930 was never detected\nsignificantly during serendipitous observations before September 2024. The\ncharacteristics of the X-ray brightening suggest the source was discovered\nduring a type II outburst reaching an X-ray peak luminosity of ~2 x 10^37\nerg/s. The trend of spectral hardening towards higher luminosities observed by\nEP suggests that the source is accreting below the critical luminosity,\nyielding an estimated lower limit for the pulsar magnetic field strength of 3.3\nx 10^12 G. The improved X-ray position confirms the candidate Be star OGLE\nJ005147.58-730924.7 as optical counterpart.

      "content": "This study proposes a method that integrates convolutional neural networks\n(CNNs) with ensemble numerical weather prediction (NWP) models, enabling\nsurface temperature forecasting at lead times beyond the short-range (five-day)\nforecast period. Owing to limited computational resources, operational\nmedium-range temperature forecasts typically rely on low-resolution NWP models,\nwhich are prone to systematic and random errors. To resolve these limitations,\nthe proposed method first reduces systematic errors through CNN-based\npost-processing (bias correction and spatial super-resolution) on each ensemble\nmember, reconstructing high-resolution temperature fields from low-resolution\nmodel outputs. Second, it reduces random errors through ensemble averaging of\nthe CNN-corrected members. This study also investigates whether the sequence of\nCNN correction and ensemble averaging affects the forecast accuracy. For\ncomparison with the proposed method, we additionally conducted experiments with\nthe CNN trained on ensemble-averaged forecasts. The first approach--CNN\ncorrection before ensemble averaging--consistently achieved higher accuracy\nthan the reverse approach. Although based on low-resolution ensemble forecasts,\nthe proposed method notably outperformed the high-resolution deterministic NWP\nmodels. These findings indicate that combining CNN-based correction with\nensemble averaging effectively reduces both the systematic and random errors in\nNWP model outputs. The proposed approach is a practical and scalable solution\nfor improving medium-range temperature forecasts, and is particularly valuable\nat operational centers with limited computational resources.",

NWP models aim for the most accurate weather\nforecasts, whereas LES models are typically used to advance our understanding\nof physical processes. Therefore, these types of models differ in their design.\nWith increasing computer power, the domain sizes and resolutions of these\nmodels converge, which raises the question if the model results also converge.\nWe investigated an idealized squall line with the NWP model ICON (ICOsahedral\nNon-hydrostatic) and the LES model MicroHH. These models differ in their\ndesign, mainly because ICON solves the compressible equations on a triangular\ngrid, while MicroHH solves the anelastic equations on a regular grid. The case\nsetup, including resolution, domain size, boundary conditions, and microphysics\nscheme, is aligned between the models. The models simulate the same squall-line\nstructure and circulation pattern in simulations with both warm and ice\nmicrophysics. However, there are quantitative differences with MicroHH having a\nmore intense squall-line circulation than ICON at all resolutions (1 km, 500 m,\nand 250 m), mainly because MicroHH has less numerical diffusion. The magnitude\nof the differences is sensitive to the advection scheme and the resolution and\nless sensitive to the formulation of turbulent diffusion.

A fifth category for film and television episode scripts was given 1974–78 and 2000–09, and a sixth category for game writing was begun in 2018. In 2019 SFWA announced that two awards that were previously run under the same rules but not considered Nebula awards—the Andre Norton Award for Middle Grade and Young Adult Fiction and the Ray Bradbury Award for Outstanding Dramatic Presentation—were to be considered official Nebula awards. The rules governing the Nebula Awards have changed several times during the awards' history, most recently in 2010. The SFWA Nebula Conference, at which the awards are announced and presented, is held each spring in the United States. Locations vary from year to year.\nThe Nebula Awards are one of the best known and most prestigious science fiction and fantasy awards and The Guardian called them \"the most important of the American science fiction awards\", together with the Hugo Awards. Winning works have been published in special collections, and winners and nominees are often noted as such on the books' covers.

      "content": "On 2022 September 5, a large solar energetic particle (SEP) event was\ndetected by Parker Solar Probe (PSP) and Solar Orbiter (SolO), at heliocentric\ndistances of 0.07 and 0.71 au, respectively. PSP observed an unusual\nvelocity-dispersion signature: particles below $\\sim$1 MeV exhibited a normal\nvelocity dispersion, while higher-energy particles displayed an inverse\nvelocity arrival feature, with the most energetic particles arriving later than\nthose at lower energies. The maximum energy increased from about 20-30 MeV\nupstream to over 60 MeV downstream of the shock. The arrival of SEPs at PSP was\nsignificantly delayed relative to the expected onset of the eruption. In\ncontrast, SolO detected a typical large SEP event characterized by a regular\nvelocity dispersion at all energies up to 100 MeV. To understand these\nfeatures, we simulate particle acceleration and transport from the shock to the\nobservers with our newly developed SEP model - Particle ARizona and MIchigan\nSolver on Advected Nodes (PARMISAN). Our results reveal that the inverse\nvelocity arrival and delayed particle onset detected by PSP originate from the\ntime-dependent diffusive shock acceleration processes. After shock passage,\nPSP's magnetic connectivity gradually shifted due to its high velocity near\nperihelion, detecting high-energy SEPs streaming sunward. Conversely, SolO\nmaintained a stable magnetic connection to the strong shock region where\nefficient acceleration was achieved. These results underscore the importance of\nspatial and temporal dependence in SEP acceleration at interplanetary shocks,\nand provide new insights to understand SEP variations in the inner heliosphere.",

The Splash occupies the high-alpha,\nhigh-[Al,K/Fe], and low-[Mn/Fe] end of the high-alpha disk population. In\nagreement with previous studies, we find that Splash stars are distributed over\nlarge heights from the Galactic mid-plane. To further elucidate the relation\nbetween the Splash and the high-alpha disk, we turn to simulations. Using a\nsample of Milky Way-like galaxies with and without major accretion events from\nthe ARTEMIS simulations, we find that Splash-like populations are ubiquitous,\nthough not always resulting from major mergers. Lower mass progenitors can also\ngenerate Splash-like features, as long as they are on retrograde orbits.\nMoreover, we find a strong correlation between the mass fraction of Splash\nstars and the fraction of retrograde accreted stars in the disk. Some galaxies\nwith minor (retrograde) mergers contain more pronounced Splash populations than\nothers with major, but prograde, mergers. For stars in the high-alpha disks, we\nalso find a decrease in the [alpha/Fe] with increasing orbital angular\nmomentum. This trend is found in hosts with both major or minor mergers. Our\nresults suggest that a number of relatively low-mass mergers on retrograde\norbits could result in populations that are qualitatively similar to the\nSplash.",

We consider non-spinning binaries over a range of total masses\nand mass ratios across a set of 22 equations of state, totaling 107 numerical\nrelativity simulations. We report the final mass and spin of the systems\n(including the accretion disk and ejecta) to be constrained in a narrow range,\nregardless of the binary configuration and matter effects. This sets them apart\nfrom binary black-hole merger remnants. We assess the detectability of the\npostmerger signal in a future 40 km Cosmic Explorer observatory and find that\nthe signal-to-noise ratio in the postmerger of an optimally located and\noriented binary at a distance of 100 Mpc can range from ${<}1$ to 8, depending\non the binary configuration and equation of state, with a majority of them\ngreater than 4 in the set of simulations that we consider. We also consider the\ndistinguishability between prompt-collapse binary neutron star and binary black\nhole mergers with the same masses and spins.

It is also working on the Blue Moon human lunar lander for NASA's Artemis program, the Blue Ring spacecraft platform, and the Orbital Reef space station in partnership with other organizations.\nFounded in 2000 by Jeff Bezos, Blue Origin initially operated with a very low profile, funded by Bezos's private investments. In 2015, the company achieved a significant milestone with the first uncrewed launch and landing of the New Shepard and announced plans for New Glenn. In 2021, New Shepard completed its first crewed mission with Bezos himself on board, crossing the Kármán line, the conventional definition of the edge of space, 100 kilometers (62 mi) above sea level. Another key achievement came in January 2023 when the company delivered its first BE-4 rocket engine to United Launch Alliance. Despite these milestones, Blue Origin has faced criticism for its perceived slow progress, particularly when compared to SpaceX. Addressing these challenges, the company underwent a leadership change in September 2023, appointing Dave Limp as CEO to succeed Bob Smith.\nOn January 16, 2025, Blue Origin reached orbit with the first launch of the New Glenn vehicle.

Multiple lines of\nevidence suggest that these bodies formed at a more distant location in\nJupiter's circumplanetary disk before coming to reside at their current\nshort-period orbits. Nonetheless, how these moons dynamically evolved to such a\nlocation has yet to be explained in the emerging paradigm of Jovian satellite\nformation. Here, we present a quantitative model for the origin of the largest\nof these inner moons, Amalthea, that can be extended to its neighbor, Thebe,\nand to other small bodies in astrophysical disks. We propose that Amalthea's\nanomalous features are due to it having formed alongside the Galileans in a\nreservoir of satellitesimals located at a large jovian-centric distance. As the\ninnermost Galilean, Io, migrated inward from this reservoir, it captured the\nsatellitesimal, Amalthea, into resonance and shepherded the small body to its\nmodern neighborhood. During migration through the disk, dissipative forcing\nfrom aerodynamic drag induces overstable librations in the Io-Amalthea\nresonance, such that only a narrow range of nebular parameters can accommodate\nthe requisite long-range transport. In particular, the disk-aspect ratio,\n$h/r$, emerges as the key variable. Our calculations indicate that the\ncircumjovian disk had a scale height of at least $h/r\\gtrsim0.08$, implying a\nrelatively hot, actively accreting disk during the epoch of satellite\nformation. These results thus shed light on the evolution of the Jovian system,\nalong with the more general phenomenon of satellite-disk interactions.",

      "content": "High-resolution spectroscopy (HRS) of exoplanet atmospheres has successfully\ndetected many chemical species and is quickly moving toward detailed\ncharacterization of the chemical abundances and dynamics. HRS is highly\nsensitive to the line shape and position, thus, it can detect three-dimensional\n(3D) effects such as winds, rotation, and spatial variation of atmospheric\nconditions. At the same time, retrieval frameworks are increasingly deployed to\nconstrain chemical abundances, pressure-temperature (P-T) structures, orbital\nparameters, and rotational broadening. To explore the multidimensional\nparameter space, they need computationally fast models that are consequently\nmostly one-dimensional (1D). However, this approach risks introducing\ninterpretation bias since the planet's true nature is 3D. We investigate the\nrobustness of this methodology at high spectral resolution by running 1D\nretrievals on simulated observations in emission within an observational\nframework using 3D Global Circulation Models of the quintessential HJ WASP-76\nb. We find that the retrieval broadly recovers conditions present in the\natmosphere, but that the retrieved P-T and chemical profiles are not a\nhomogeneous average of all spatial and phase-dependent information. Instead,\nthey are most sensitive to spatial regions with large thermal gradients, which\ndo not necessarily coincide with the strongest emitting regions. Our results\nfurther suggest that the choice of parameterization for the P-T and chemical\nprofiles, as well as Doppler offsets among opacity sources, impact retrieval\nresults. These factors should be carefully considered in future retrieval\nanalyses.",

For Solar-mass stars in the Galactic field, the distribution of\norbital separations is log-normal over seven orders of magnitude, from $10^{-2}\n- 10^5$ au. In contrast, the separation distributions of systems in nearby\nstar-forming regions paints a much more confusing picture. There appears to be\nan excess of systems in the separation range 10 - 1000 au, and recent\nhigh-resolution spectroscopic observations of close (<10 au) systems suggest a\nfield-like distribution in some star-forming regions, but a possible excess\nwith respect to the field in other regions. Furthermore, the resolution limit\nof numerical simulations of binary star formation is $\\sim$1\\,au, and\nconsequently comparisons with the binary distributions in star-forming regions\nand in the field are restricted.

Star forming\nregions and young stars are generally strongly associated to the spiral\nstructure, but there are few quantitative predictions from simulations about\nthe involvement of stars of different ages. Aims. We aim to quantify the\ninterplay between spiral arms and different populations. Methods. We use a\nhydrodynamical simulation of an isolated disc galaxy displaying a dynamic\nmulti-armed spiral structure. Inspired by cosmological structure metrics, we\ndevelop a new method, the local dimension, that robustly delineates arms across\npopulations and through space and time. Results. We find that all stars,\nincluding those as old as 11Gyr, support the arms. The spiral strength\ndecreases with stellar age up to 2Gyr-old stars and remains nearly constant for\nolder stars. However, the scaling between arm strength and age (or velocity\ndispersion) depends on the strength of the global spiral structure at each\ntime. Almost all stars formed in arms remain within them for no more than\n140-180Myr, whereas old stars leave arms about three times faster. Even if the\nyoungest populations dominate in the production of the spiral torques at early\ntimes, all populations contribute equally at later times. Conclusions. Our\nresults highlight the power of the local dimension for studying complex spiral\nstructures and show that all stellar populations in the disc partake in the\narms. Since in our model we see spiral arms in populations with velocity\ndispersions up to 90km/s, which are comparable to those of the Milky Way, we\npredict that old Galactic populations could also exhibit spiral structure.",

However, findings are not limited to this period; for example, the Venus of Hohle Fels dates back at least 35,000 years to the Aurignacian era, and the Venus of Monruz dates back about 11,000 years to the Magdalenian. Such figurines were carved from soft stone (such as steatite, calcite or limestone), bone or ivory, or formed of clay and fired. The latter are among the oldest ceramics known to historians. In total, over 200 such figurines are known; virtually all of modest size, between about 3 and 40 cm (1.2 and 15.7 in) in height. These figurines are recognised as some of the earliest works of prehistoric art.\nMost have wide hips and legs that taper to a point. Arms and feet are often absent, and the head is usually small and faceless. Various figurines exaggerate the abdomen, hips, breasts, thighs, or vulva, although many found examples do not reflect these typical characteristics. Depictions of hairstyles can be detailed, and clothing or tattoos may be indicated.\nThe original cultural meaning and purpose of these artefacts is not known. It has frequently been suggested that they may have served a ritual or symbolic function.

Here, we investigate the spectral, cometary, and rotational properties\nof 3I/ATLAS as well as its dynamical context.\n  Methods. We identified the spectral type of 3I/ATLAS from the visible\nreflectance spectrum and used photometric observations to derive its level of\nactivity and rotational properties. Observational data were obtained with the\nOSIRIS camera spectrograph at the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias and the\nTwo-meter Twin Telescope. We used N-body simulations and statistical analyses\nof Gaia DR3 data to investigate the origin of 3I/ATLAS and its Galactic\nbackground.\n  Results. Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has a visible spectrum slightly redder\nthan those of D-type asteroids, 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, with a spectral\nslope of 18.3%/1000 A in the 4000-9000 A range, which is similar to those of\nTNOs and Centaurs. It has a conspicuous coma and its rotation period is 16.79\nh. The heliocentric components of its Galactic velocity were (U, V, W) =\n(-51.233, -19.456, 18.930) km/s with a radiant in Sagittarius. The analysis of\na sample of kinematic analogs of 3I/ATLAS extracted from Gaia DR3 suggests that\nits parent system is part of the Galactic thin disk and includes a solar-like\nstar with slightly sub-solar metallicity.",

      "content": "Low redshift fast radio bursts (FRBs) provide robust measurements of the\nhost-galaxy contribution to the dispersion measure (DM), which can constrain\nthe circumgalactic medium (CGM) of the hosts. We curate a sample of 20 nearby\nFRBs with low scattering timescales and face-on host galaxies with stellar\nmasses ranging from $10^9 < M^* / M_\\odot < 10^{11}$. We fit the distribution\nof the host galaxy DM to a quadratic model as a function of stellar mass with a\nmass-independent scatter and find that the more massive the host, the lower its\nhost DM. We report that this relation has a negative slope of $m = -97 \\pm 44$\npc/cm$^{-3}$ per dex in stellar mass. We compare this measurement to similar\nfits to three sub-grid models implemented in the CAMELS suite of simulations\nfrom Astrid, IllustrisTNG, and SIMBA and find that fine-tuning of the host ISM\ncontribution as a function of stellar mass is required in order to reconcile\nthe observational data with the predictions of the fiducial CAMELS-Astrid\nmodel. More generally, models which attribute a positive correlation between\nstellar mass and host dispersion measure ($m > 0$) to the CGM are in tension\nwith our measurement. We show that this conclusion is robust to a wide range of\nassumptions, such as the offset distribution of FRBs from their hosts and the\nstatistics of the cosmic contribution to the DM budget along each sightline.\nOur results indirectly imply a lower limit on the strength of baryonic feedback\nin the Local Universe $(z < 0.2)$ in isolated $\\sim L^*$ halos, complementing\nresults from weak lensing surveys and kSZ observations which target higher halo\nmass and redshift ranges.",

      "content": "A theoretical model on the basis of fluid-Maxwell equations for an\nelectron-ion plasma is presented which describes the conversion of\ncurrent-driven Langmuir waves into type III radiation whereby simultaneously an\nexcitation of whistler waves may occur. In contrast to the classical approach\nof Ginzburg and Zhelezniakov (1958) after which beam-excited Langmuir waves in\na two-step process are converted in electromagnetic radiation, the presented\nmechanism works without any instability and wave coalescence. Rather the\nelectric field oscillations at the electron plasma frequency can be triggered\nby different realisations of the driving current, e.g. by the (uncompensated)\nnet current of the strahl at t=0 in a core-strahl plasma or by given current\nvariations which may represent different situations in space, as shocks,\nmagnetic switch-backs etc.. A linearized system of equations is used to\ndescribe the mode coupling occurring at oblique propagation between the mostly\nelectrostatic Langmuir wave and the adjacent electromagnetic left-hand\npolarized (L) wave. The simplicity of the fluid model allows without great\neffort the parameters of the current profiles to be varied and thus to simulate\na wide range of possible experimental conditions. Measurements of Langmuir\nwaves, type III radiation and whistler waves on board various satellites in the\nsolar wind, and in particular some of the recent results of the Parker Solar\nProbe are interpreted in the light of the theoretical model presented. For the\ncase of the uncompensated strahl, the fluid approach is confirmed by fully\nkinetic PIC simulations. One comparison is shown in the Appendix.",

      "content": "A supernova remnant (SNR) is the structure resulting from the explosion of a star in a supernova.  The supernova remnant is bounded by an expanding shock wave, and consists of ejected material expanding from the explosion, and the interstellar material it sweeps up and shocks along the way.\nThere are two common routes to a supernova: either a massive star may run out of fuel, ceasing to generate fusion energy in its core, and collapsing inward under the force of its own gravity to form a neutron star or a black hole; or a white dwarf star may accrete material from a companion star until it reaches a critical mass and undergoes a thermonuclear explosion.\nIn either case, the resulting supernova explosion expels much or all of the stellar material with velocities as much as 10% the speed of light (or approximately 30,000 km/s) and a strong shock wave forms ahead of the ejecta. That heats the upstream plasma up to temperatures well above millions of K. The shock continuously slows down over time as it sweeps up the ambient medium, but it can expand over hundreds or thousands of years and over tens of parsecs before its speed falls below the local sound speed.\nOne of the best observed young supernova remnants was formed by SN 1987A, a supernova in the Large Magellanic Cloud that was observed in February 1987. Other well-known supernova remnants include the Crab Nebula; Tycho, the remnant of SN 1572, named after Tycho Brahe who recorded the brightness of its original explosion; and Kepler, the remnant of SN 1604, named after Johannes Kepler. The youngest known remnant in the Milky Way is G1.9+0.3, discovered in the Galactic Center.",

Chandra is sensitive to X-ray sources 100 times fainter than any previous X-ray telescope, enabled by the high angular resolution of its mirrors. Since the Earth's atmosphere absorbs the vast majority of X-rays, they are not detectable from Earth-based telescopes; therefore space-based telescopes are required to make these observations. Chandra is an Earth satellite in a 64-hour orbit, and its mission is ongoing as of 2025. Chandra is one of the Great Observatories, along with the Hubble Space Telescope, Compton Gamma Ray Observatory (1991–2000), and the Spitzer Space Telescope (2003–2020). The telescope is named after the Nobel Prize-winning Indian-American astrophysicist Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar. Its mission is similar to that of ESA's XMM-Newton spacecraft, also launched in 1999 but the two telescopes have different design foci, as Chandra has a much higher angular resolution and XMM-Newton higher spectroscopy throughput.\nIn response to a decrease in NASA funding in 2024 by the US Congress, Chandra is threatened with an early cancellation despite having more than a decade of operation left. The cancellation has been referred to as a potential \"extinction-level\" event for X-ray astronomy in the US. A group of astronomers have put together a public outreach project to try to get enough American citizens to persuade the US Congress to provide enough funding to avoid early termination of the observatory.",

The simplified forms of shock jump relations have been written\nsimultaneously for the weak and strong MHD shock waves in terms of the magnetic\nfield strength, the non-idealness parameter, and the ratio of specific heats of\nthe gas. Further, the case of weak shocks has been explored under two distinct\nconditions, viz., (i) when the applied magnetic field is weak and (ii) when the\nfield is strong, respectively. The case of strong shocks has also been\ninvestigated under two distinct ways: (i) as in the purely non-magnetic case,\nwhen the ratio of densities on either side of the shock nearly equals\n$(\\gamma+1)/(\\gamma-1)$ or (ii) when the applied magnetic field is large. This\nis when the ambient magnetic pressure is large as compared with the ambient gas\npressure. Finally, the effects on the shock strength and the pressure across\nthe MHD shock front are studied due to the magnetic field strength and the\nnon-idealness parameter of the gases.

Strong magnetic\nfields decelerate core rotation, affecting mode excitation. Regardless of the\ninitial rotation, convection consistently drives a low-frequency mode that\nlasts throughout the evolution.

The population of the Greater Marshall area, comprising all of Harrison County, was 65,631 in 2010 and 66,726 in 2018.\nMarshall and Harrison County were important political and production areas of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. This area of Texas was developed for cotton plantations. Planters brought slaves with them from other regions or bought them in the domestic slave trade. The county had the highest number of slaves in the state, and East Texas had a higher proportion of slaves than other regions of the state. The wealth of the county and city depended on slave labor and the cotton market.\nFrom the late 19th century to the mid-20th century, Marshall developed as a center of the Texas and Pacific Railway. After World War II, activists in the city's substantial African-American population worked to create social change through the Civil Rights Movement, with considerable support from the historically black colleges and universities in the area.\nThe city is known for holding one of the largest light festivals in the United States, the \"Wonderland of Lights\". It calls itself the \"Pottery Capital of the World\" for its sizable pottery industry. Marshall has various nicknames: the \"Cultural Capital of East Texas\", the \"Gateway of Texas\", the \"Athens of Texas\", the \"City of Seven Flags\", and \"Center Stage\", a branding slogan adopted by the Marshall Convention and Visitors Bureau.",

      "content": "Continuing our study of the effects of secular resonances on the formation of\nterrestrial planets in moderately close binary stars, we present here the\nresults of an extensive numerical simulations of the formation of these\nobjects. Considering a binary with two giant planets and a protoplanetary disk\naround its primary star, we have simulated the late stage of terrestrial planet\nformation for different types of the secondary, and different orbital elements\nof the binary and giant planets. Results demonstrate that terrestrial planet\nformation can indeed proceed constructively in such systems; however, as\npredicted by the general theory, secular resonances are suppressed and do not\ncontribute to the formation process. Simulations show that it is in fact the\nmean-motion resonances of the inner giant planet that drive the dynamics of the\nprotoplanetary disk and the mass and orbital architecture of the final bodies.\nSimulations also show that in the majority of the cases, the final systems\ncontain only one terrestrial planet with a mass of 0.6-1.7 Earth masses.\nMultiple planets appear on rare occasions in the form of Earth-Mars analogs\nwith the smaller planet in an exterior orbit. When giant planets are in larger\norbits, the number of these double-planet systems increases and their planets\nbecome more massive. Results also show that when the orbits of the giant\nplanets carry inclinations, while secular resonances are still suppressed,\nmean-motion resonances are strongly enhanced, drastically reducing the efficacy\nof the formation process. We present the results of our simulations and discuss\ntheir implications.",

Materials engineering is an engineering field of finding uses for materials in other fields and industries.\nThe intellectual origins of materials science stem from the Age of Enlightenment, when researchers began to use analytical thinking from chemistry, physics, and engineering to understand ancient, phenomenological observations in metallurgy and mineralogy. Materials science still incorporates elements of physics, chemistry, and engineering. As such, the field was long considered by academic institutions as a sub-field of these related fields. Beginning in the 1940s, materials science began to be more widely recognized as a specific and distinct field of science and engineering, and major technical universities around the world created dedicated schools for its study.\nMaterials scientists emphasize understanding how the history of a material (processing) influences its structure, and thus the material's properties and performance. The understanding of processing -structure-properties relationships is called the materials paradigm. This paradigm is used to advance understanding in a variety of research areas, including nanotechnology, biomaterials, and metallurgy.\nMaterials science is also an important part of forensic engineering and failure analysis –  investigating materials, products, structures or components, which fail or do not function as intended, causing personal injury or damage to property. Such investigations are key to understanding, for example, the causes of various aviation accidents and incidents.",

Their\nevolution remains unclear, as identifying counterparts at lower redshifts is\nchallenging. We present WISEA J123635.56+621424.2 (here dubbed {\\it the\nSaguaro}), a $z=2.0145$ galaxy in GOODS-North, as a possible analog of\nhigh-redshift LRDs and a potential missing link in their evolutionary path\ntoward lower-redshift systems. It features a compact LRD-like nucleus\nsurrounded by a face-on spiral host. Its connection to LRDs includes that: (1)\nits nuclear spectrum shows a clear \"V-shaped\" SED; and (2) when redshifted to\n$z=7$, surface brightness dimming makes the host undetectable, thus mimicking\nan LRD. This suggests that high-redshift LRDs may be embedded in extended\nhosts. To test this, we stack rest-frame UV images of 99 photometrically\nselected LRDs, revealing faint, diffuse emission. Stacking in redshift bins\nreveals mild radial growth, consistent with the expected galaxy size evolution.\nA simple analytic model confirms that surface brightness dimming alone can\nexplain their compact appearance. Lastly, we show that {\\it the Saguaro} is not\nunique by describing similar objects from the literature at $z\\lesssim3.5$.\nTaken together, our results support a scenario in which LRDs may not be a\ndistinct population, but could be the visible nuclei of galaxies undergoing a\nshort-lived, AGN-dominated evolutionary phase, with their compact, red\nappearance driven largely by observational biases.",

      "content": "Over the past 40 years the brightness variations of XX Tri, a single line RS\nCVn type binary system with a synchronized K-giant primary, has exceeded one\nmagnitude in the V band. Although these changes are primarily caused by\nstarspots, an additional activity-related mechanism may also be behind the\nlong-term trend of overall brightness increase.\n  By compiling the most complete photometric data set so far, we attempt to\nexamine how the nature of seasonal-to-decadal changes can be linked to global\nmagnetism.\n  The long-term brightening of XX Tri was accompanied by a gradual increase in\nthe effective temperature, which resulted in a blueing shift in the\nHerzsprung-Russell diagram. In the long term, a constant cycle of about 4 years\nis most strongly present in the entire data. Besides, we also found a\nmodulation of about 11 years, and a slowly decreasing cycle of about 5.7-5.2\nyears. From the seasonal datasets we found that the most dominant\nrotation-related periods are scattered around the orbital period. From this we\ninfer a solar-type surface differential rotation, although the surface shear is\nsignificantly smaller than that of the Sun.\n  The 4-year cycle indicates flip-flop-like behavior: during this time, the 2-3\nactive longitudes usually present on the stellar surface are rearranged. The\nmagnitude-range changes in the long term cannot be interpreted solely as\nchanges in the number and size of spots; the unspotted brightness of XX Tri has\nalso increased over the decades. This should alert users of photometric spot\nmodels to reconsider the basic concept of constant unspotted brightness in\nsimilar cases.",

To\ninvestigate this response, we model the impact of an icy cometary body with an\nEarth-analogue exoplanet (i.e. an Earth-like planet orbiting a Sun-like star\nwith a diurnal cycle) using a cometary impact and breakup model coupled with\nthe 3D Earth-System-Model WACCM6/CESM2. To quantify the role that the\natmospheric dynamics play in setting the response to a cometary impact, we\ncompare our results with a previous study investigating an impact with a\ntidally-locked terrestrial exoplanet. We find that the circulation regime of\nthe planet plays a key role in shaping the response of the atmosphere to an icy\ncometary impact. The weak, multi-celled circulation structure that forms on\nEarth-like planets is efficient at mixing material horizontally but not\nvertically, limiting the transport of water from the deep break-up site to\nhigher altitudes. In turn, this limits the rate of water photodissociation at\nlow pressures, reducing the magnitude of post-impact changes to composition. It\nalso reduces the potential observability of an impact due to weakened cloud ice\nformation, and hence scattering, at low pressures. Despite this, small changes\nto the overall composition of the planet persist to quasi-steady-state,\nreinforcing the idea that ongoing bombardment may help to shape the\ncomposition/habitability of terrestrial worlds.",

This generated a large amount of coverage in the popular media, and the comet was closely observed by astronomers worldwide. The collision provided new information about Jupiter and highlighted its possible role in reducing space debris in the inner Solar System.\nThe comet was discovered by astronomers Carolyn and Eugene M. Shoemaker, and David Levy in 1993. Shoemaker–Levy 9 (SL9) had been captured by Jupiter and was orbiting the planet at the time. It was located on the night of March 24 in a photograph taken with the 46 cm (18 in) Schmidt telescope at the Palomar Observatory in California. It was the first active comet observed to be orbiting a planet, and had probably been captured by Jupiter around 20 to 30 years earlier.\nCalculations showed that its unusual fragmented form was due to a previous closer approach to Jupiter in July 1992. At that time, the orbit of Shoemaker–Levy 9 passed within Jupiter's Roche limit, and Jupiter's tidal forces had acted to pull the comet apart. The comet was later observed as a series of fragments ranging up to 2 km (1.2 mi) in diameter. These fragments collided with Jupiter's southern hemisphere between July 16 and 22, 1994 at a speed of approximately 60 km/s (37 mi/s) (Jupiter's escape velocity) or 216,000 km/h (134,000 mph).

However, achieving stable, long-range\nautoregressive forecasts beyond a few weeks remains a significant challenge.\nPrevailing state-of-the-art models that achieve year-long stability, such as\nSFNO and DLWP-HPX, have relied on transforming input data onto non-standard\nspatial domains like spherical harmonics or HEALPix meshes. This has led to the\nprevailing assumption that such representations are necessary to enforce\nphysical consistency and long-term stability. This paper challenges that\nassumption by investigating whether comparable long-range performance can be\nachieved on the standard latitude-longitude grid. We introduce AtmosMJ, a deep\nconvolutional network that operates directly on ERA5 data without any spherical\nremapping. The model's stability is enabled by a novel Gated Residual Fusion\n(GRF) mechanism, which adaptively moderates feature updates to prevent error\naccumulation over long recursive simulations. Our results demonstrate that\nAtmosMJ produces stable and physically plausible forecasts for about 500 days.\nIn quantitative evaluations, it achieves competitive 10-day forecast accuracy\nagainst models like Pangu-Weather and GraphCast, all while requiring a\nremarkably low training budget of 5.7 days on a V100 GPU.

These currents play a crucial role in mediating\nvertical exchange between the surface and ocean interior and in facilitating\ncross-scale energy transfers. Despite a growing understanding of their\ngeneration mechanisms and energy pathways, two fundamental questions remain\nunresolved - how does a finite Ro modify the dynamics of ML instabilities, and\nwhat mechanisms are responsible for ML frontal arrest when Ro is order one. In\nthis study, we address these questions through a linear stability analysis of a\ntwo-dimensional, geostrophically adjusted oceanic front based on the analytical\nmodel of Ou(1984), which allows systematic exploration across a range of Ro. In\nthe low Ro, order one Ri regime, the most unstable mode is that of baroclinic\ninstability, with the buoyancy flux serving as the primary source of\nperturbation kinetic energy. As Ro increases, the dominant instability becomes\nan inertia-critical layer type, characterized by a resonant interaction between\na Rossby wave and an inertia-gravity wave. In the order one Ro regime, the\nshear production terms become comparable to the buoyancy flux term and even\ndominate in the region where the adjusted front is strongest.

Using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach, we\nconstrain key dust properties including temperature, surface density, maximum\ngrain size, composition, filling factor, and size distribution. The full\nfitting, with all parameters free, shows a preference for organics-rich dust\nwith a low filling factor in the outer region ($r \\gtrsim 40$ au), where the\nspectral index is $\\sim3.7$, but amorphous-carbon-rich dust also reasonably\nreproduces the observed intensity profiles. Considering the scattering\npolarization observed at 0.87 mm, compact, amorphous-carbon-rich dust is\nunlikely, and moderately porous dust is favored. Beyond 40 au, the maximum dust\nsize is likely $\\sim100~{\\rm \\mu m}$ if dust is compact or amorphous-carbon\nrich. However, if the dust is moderately porous and organics-rich, both the\npredicted dust surface density and dust size can be sufficiently large for the\npebble accretion rate to reach $\\sim10M_{\\oplus}~{\\rm Myr^{-1}}$ in most\nregions, suggesting that pebble accretion could be a key mechanism for forming\nplanets in the disk. In contrast, if the dust is amorphous-carbon-rich, forming\na giant planet core via pebble accretion is unlikely due to the combined\neffects of low dust surface density and small dust size required to match the\nobserved emission, suggesting other mechanisms, such as disk fragmentation due\nto gravitational instability, may be responsible for planet formation in the HL\nTau disk.",

Wavenumber-frequency diagrams of zonal\nwinds from all models show a clear signature of Rossby and Kelvin waves with\nequivalent depths that are in accord with observations and reanalysis.\nComposites of Kelvin waves show correct lower and upper troposphere horizontal\nconvergence patterns, vertical tilts in temperature, humidity and vertical\nvelocity as well as the phase relation between temperature and vertical\nvelocity anomalies. Though, differences between models are notable such as\nsmaller vertical tilts and incorrect surface temperature anomalies in GraphCast\nand relatively weak convergent flows in PanguWeather. The models had much more\ndifficulty with Rossby waves; while the horizontal gyres were captured, the\nvertical structure of temperature and divergence was incorrect. Apart from\nunexpected tilts in various fields, the temperature anomaly was inconsistent\nwith the nature of the vertical velocity in all four models. Curiously,\nmoisture and vertical velocity anomalies were much closer to observations.\nFurther, only two models (GraphCast and FourCastNet) captured the simultaneous\ngeneration of deep vertical motion with moisture anomalies.

Here, we measure the fine-scale motions of network\nbright points along a coronal hole boundary in high-resolution H-alpha images\nfrom the 1.6m Goode Solar Telescope at Big Bear Solar Observatory to quantify\nthe agitation of open flux tubes into generating Alfvenic pulses. We combine\nthe motion, magnetic flux, and activity duration of the flux tubes to estimate\nthe energy content carried by individual Alfvenic pulses, which is ~10+25 erg,\nadequately higher than the energies ~10+23 erg estimated for the magnetic\nswitchbacks observed by the Parker Solar Probe (PSP). This implies the\npossibility that the surface-generated Alfvenic pulses could reach the solar\nwind with sufficient energy to generate switchbacks, even though some of then\nare expected to be reflected back in the stratified solar atmosphere. Alfvenic\npulses further reproduce for the first time other properties of switchbacks,\nincluding the filling factor above ~8% at granular and supergranular scales,\nwhich correspond best to the lower end of the mesoscale structure.

More precisely, we consider the leading-order terms of\nthe spherically symmetric Johanssen-Psaltis (JP) and Konoplya-Zhidenko (KZ)\nparametrizations after imposing constraints from asymptotic flatness and solar\nsystem observations. Furthermore, we use the inferred correlation, by the Event\nHorizon Telescope Collaboration, between the size of the bright ring (which is\ndirectly observable) and the size of the central brightness depression (which\nis not) of M87 and Sgr A$^*$ central supermassive objects, to constrain the\nparameters of the leading-order JP and KZ solutions. Using ten samples of the\nStandard Unbound distribution previously employed in the literature to\nreproduce certain scenarios of General Relativistic HydroDynamical simulations,\nwe produce images of four samples of JP and KZ geometries enhancing and\ndiminishing the shadow's size, respectively. Via a qualitative and quantitative\nanalysis of the features of the corresponding photon rings and, in particular,\nof their relative brightness, we argue that it should be possible to\ndistinguish between such parametrized solutions and the Schwarzschild geometry\nvia future upgrades of very long baseline interferometry.

In AdS/CFT\nwith a prescribed classical limit, pure JT gravity in \\textit{one-sided}\nAdS$_{2}$ black hole is argued to be described by certain holographic deformed\nCFT on a strip.

As the first\nphase of our project, we present here the general theory of secular resonances\nin dual-star systems where the primary hosts two giant planets. Using the\nconcept of generalized disturbing function, we derive the formula for the\nlocations of secular resonances and show that in systems where the perturbation\nof the secondary star is stronger, the locations of secular resonances are\nfarther way from the primary and closer to the giant planets. The latter\nimplies that in such systems, terrestrial planet formation has a larger area to\nproceed with more of the protoplanetary disk being available to it. To\ndemonstrate the validity of our theoretical results, we simulated the evolution\nof a protoplanetary disk interior to the inner giant planet. Results, in\naddition to confirming our theoretical predictions, pointed to an important\nfinding: In binary stars, the perturbation of the secondary suppresses the\nsecular resonances of giant planets. Simulations also show that as the disk\nloses material, secular resonances move inward, scattering objects out of the\ndisk and/or facilitating their collisional growth. We present results of our\nstudy and discuss their implications for the simulations of terrestrial planet\nformation.",

The simulations started at the protoplanetary disk stage, when\nplanetesimals formed and accreted into protoplanets, and continued past the\nlate stage of giant impacts. We explored the effect of different parameters,\nsuch as the initial radial distribution of planetesimals and Type-I migration\nof protoplanets, on the final results. In each case, a thousand simulations\nwere completed to characterize the stochastic nature of the accretion process.\nIn the model best able to satisfy various constraints, Mercury, Venus, and\nEarth accreted from planetesimals that formed early near the silicate\nsublimation line near 0.5 au and migrated by disk torques. For Venus and Earth\nto end up at 0.7-1 au, Type-I migration had to be directed outward, for example\nas the magnetically driven winds reduced the surface gas density in the inner\npart of the disk. Mercury was left behind near the original ring location. We\nsuggest that Mars and multiple Mars-sized protoplanets grew from a distinct\nouter source of planetesimals at 1.5-2 au. While many migrated inwards to\naccrete onto the proto-Earth, our Mars was the lone survivor. This model\nexplains: (1) the masses and orbits of the terrestrial planets, (2) the\nchemical composition of the Earth, where ~70% and ~30% come from reduced\ninner-ring and more-oxidized outer-ring materials, and (3) the isotopic\ndifferences of the Earth and Mars.

Nutation\ncomponents in the retrograde quasi-diurnal frequency band measured in the\nterrestrial reference frame are amplified by resonance with the Free Core\nNutation (FCN), a rotational mode of Earth's fluid core. Dissipative processes\nat the core-mantle boundary (CMB) dampen this resonance, contributing to the\nobserved phase lag between tidal forcing and Earth's rotational response. This\nphase lag is commonly attributed to electromagnetic (EM) coupling between the\ncore and the electrically conducting lower mantle. However, estimates of mantle\nconductivity and radial magnetic field strength at the CMB suggest these\neffects are insufficient. We show that the missing dissipation arises naturally\nfrom the excitation of internal waves in the fluid core by topographic features\nat the CMB. Adapting a theoretical framework originally developed for tidal\nflow over oceanic topography, we compute the form drag and associated power\nflux induced by CMB topography. Our results are consistent with a CMB\ntopography characterized by a root mean square amplitude of a few kilometers.\nThe model favors weak stratification at the top of the core, though stronger\nstratification remains compatible with increased topographic amplitude. This\nmechanism provides independent constraints on CMB topography and\nstratification, complementing seismological and magnetic observations.

The utilized\none-dimensional diffraction-limited coronagraph (1DDLC) has promising features\n(binary nuller, small inner working angles (IWAs)). Still, it has a performance\nthat is highly sensitive to spectral bandwidth and tilt aberrations.\nNevertheless, for the 1DDLC, wavelengths other than the design wavelength\nintroduce leaks with a flat wavefront on the Lyot-stop plane, preserving the\nsame complex amplitude profile as an on-axis point source. This property\nsupports the concept of serially coupling additional nullers after the 1DDLC.\nThe fiber-nulling unit employs a Lyot-plane mask, relay optics (1/100$\\times$),\nand a single-mode fiber. The Lyot-plane mask splits the incoming beam --\ncomprising leakage from the 1DDLC and planetary light -- into four beams so\nthat, in principle, the on-axis single-mode fiber does not couple with the\non-axis leak from the 1DDLC.

      "content": "The age distribution function of star clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud\n(LMC) is known to present a feature called the cluster age gap, a period of\ntime from ~ 4 to 11 Gyr ago with a remarkable small number of clusters\nidentified. In this work we performed an in-depth analysis of three recently\ncatalogued age gap cluster candidates with the aim of confirming their physical\nnature. We used GEMINI@GMOS g,i photometry centred on the objects to build\ncolour-magnitude diagrams from which we recognised their main features. We also\nperformed an automatic search of stellar overdensities using Gaussian mixture\nmodel techniques and analysed the corresponding colour-magnitude diagrams\nsimilarly as performed for the aforementioned candidates. The present GEMINI\ndata sets would seem to discard any strong evidence of these object being real\nclusters, and rather support the possibility of the result of stellar density\nvariations of the LMC field star distribution. These three objects, in addition\nto other 17 new identified candidates, are placed in the LMC outermost disc in\na limited region toward the southwest from the LMC centre. They had embraced\nthe possibility to answer the long-time conundrum about the absence of LMC age\ngap clusters. From an statistical approach, combined with the knowledge of the\nexpected LMC age-metallicity relationship, and recent simulations of the\ninteraction between the LMC and the Milky Way, we provide not only evidence\nagainst the physical nature of the studied objects, but also an interpretation\non the lack of identification of more LMC age gap clusters.",

      "title": "Orbit dissimilarity criteria in meteor showers: a comparative review",
      "content": "In meteor science, the identification of meteor showers is a crucial and\ncomplex problem. The most common method is to perform a systematic search of a\ndatabase of observed orbits using an orbit dissimilarity criterion\n(D-criterion) and an algorithm. D-criteria compare the result of an orbit\ndissimilarity function (D-function) and a threshold. These D-functions\nassociate one value to two meteoroids orbits. If this value is lower than the\nthreshold, the meteoroids' orbits are considered similar. Group of meteors are\nthus formed. However, not all D-criteria have been evaluated, and their high\nnumber makes it hard to know which should be prioritised. This paper presents a\nreview of each D-function, the tests they passed, the threshold choice, and the\nalgorithms they are used with. We show what methods are currently used in the\nsearch for meteor showers, presenting statistics based on papers justifying the\nexistence of established meteor showers. We review D-functions from eight\ndifferent papers. We describe how thresholds and clustering algorithms are\nusually chosen. We also analyse tests that were performed on D-criteria. We\ndiscover that most of those criteria were not properly tested, and that some\nhave been criticised for their theoretical background. Thus, we recommend\nperforming a post-search analysis of the groups found, both in a statistical\nsense (to make sure the groups formed could not have been formed randomly) and\nan orbital dynamics sense (to check whether the group could indeed come from a\nsingular parent body), to present the findings as potential meteor showers.",

      "content": "In this work, we apply a soft-sphere discrete element method (SSDEM) within\nthe PKDGRAV N-body integrator to investigate the formation of planetesimal\nsystems through the gravitational collapse of clouds of super-particles.\nPreviously published numerical models have demonstrated that the gravitational\ncollapse of pebble clouds is an efficient pathway to produce binary\nplanetesimal systems. However, such investigations were limited by their use of\na perfect-merger and inflated-radii super-particle approach, which inhibits any\nanalysis of planetesimal shapes and spin states, precludes the formation of the\ntightest binary orbits, and produces significantly under-dense planetesimals.\nThe SSDEM enables super-particles to rest upon each other through mutual\nsurface penetration and by simulating contact physics. Super-particles do not\nneed to be inflated and collisions are not treated as perfect mergers; we can\nthus track the evolution of planetesimal shapes, spins, and tight binary\norbits. We demonstrate that the SSDEM is an excellent method to model the\ncollapse process, and is capable of producing many binary planetesimal systems\nfrom a single cloud. Our results confirm the findings of previously published\nperfect-merging models while also producing novel results about planetesimal\nspin and shape properties. Newly-formed planetesimals exhibit 10-hr rotation\nperiods on average and can be characterized by a wide variety of shapes\n(spherical, oblate, top-shaped, flattened, egg-shaped, or prolate), with the\nmost-massive planetesimals primarily forming as spheres and oblate-spheroids.",

Here, we\npresent observations of the surface reflectance of 43 small to mid-size (H_V >~\n5) transneptunian objects (TNOs) through the grz wavelength range, 14 of which\nare plutinos. We classify the surfaces of these TNOs using the two-surface\nclass model (FaintIR and BrightIR surface classes) proposed by Fraser and\ncollaborators, where the FaintIR surface class is dominated by cold classicals.\nIncorporating similar observations of plutinos from the literature for a total\nsample size of 43 plutinos, we find that the osculating inclination\ndistributions (i_osc) of the FaintIR and BrightIR plutinos are statistically\ndistinguishable at 99.3% significance, where (6/7) of the plutinos with i_osc >\n4.5{\\deg} have FaintIR surfaces.

On Earth, high-speed\nsolar-wind streams may lead to severe disruption of satellite operations and\npower grids. Accurate and reliable forecasting of the ambient solar-wind speed\nis therefore highly desirable. This work presents an encoder-decoder\nneural-network framework for simultaneously forecasting the daily averaged\nsolar-wind speed for the subsequent four days. The encoder-decoder framework is\ntrained with the two different modes of solar observations. The history of\nsolar-wind observations from prior solar-rotations and EUV coronal observations\nup to four days prior to the current time form the input to two different\nencoders. The decoder is designed to output the daily averaged solar-wind speed\nfrom four days prior to the current time to four days into the future. Our\nmodel outputs the solar-wind speed with Root-Mean-Square Errors (RMSEs) of 55\nkm/s, 58 km/s, 58 km/s, and 58 km/s and Pearson correlations of 0.78, 0.66,\n0.64 and 0.63 for one to four days in advance respectively. While the model is\ntrained and validated on observations between 2010 - 2018, we demonstrate its\nrobustness via application on unseen test data between 2019 - 2023, yielding\nRMSEs of 53 km/s and Pearson correlations 0.55 for a four-day advance\nprediction. Our encoder-decoder model thus produces much improved RMSE values\ncompared to the previous works and paves the way for developing comprehensive\nmultimodal deep learning models for operational solar wind forecasting.",

While seismometers and geophones are commonly\nemployed to monitor ground motion for Newtonian noise cancellation, their\nlimited spatial coverage and high deployment costs hinder scalability. In this\nstudy, we demonstrate that distributed acoustic sensing offers a viable and\nscalable alternative, providing performance comparable to that of conventional\nseismic instruments. Using data from acoustic sensing and colocated\nseismometers during both natural and controlled events, we observe a strong\ncorrelation, exceeding 0.8, between the two sensor types in the 3 to 20 Hz\nfrequency band relevant for Newtonian noise. Moreover, when distributed\nacoustic sensing data are used to predict geophone signals, the correlation\nremains high, above 0.7, indicating that distributed acoustic sensing\naccurately captures both the spatial and spectral features of ground motion. As\na case study, we apply distributed acoustic sensing data to cancel noise\nrecorded by the vertical component of a seismometer and compare the results\nwith those obtained using geophone data for the same task. Both distributed\nacoustic sensing and geophone-based cancellations yield a residual noise factor\nof 0.11 at 20 Hz.

The putative stellar companion is thought to cause\nthe long photometric modulation observed in Betelgeuse, which cannot be\nexplained by stellar pulsations. Additionally, radial velocity and astrometric\ndata also point to a stellar companion. Here we present diffraction-limited\noptical speckle imaging observations obtained on the 8.1-meter Gemini North\ntelescope in 2020 and 2024. The 2020 observations were taken during the Great\nDimming event, and at a time when the stellar companion was predicted to be\nunobservable because it was directly in-line with Betelgeuse itself. The 2024\nobservations were taken three days after the predicted time of greatest\nelongation for the companion. A comparison of the 2020 and 2024 data reveal no\ncompanion in 2020 (as expected) and the probable detection of a companion in\n2024. The presumed stellar companion has an angular separation and position\nangle of 52 mas and $115^\\circ$ east of north, respectively, which is in\nexcellent agreement with predictions from dynamical considerations. The\ndetected companion is roughly six magnitudes fainter than Betelgeuse at 466\nnm.\\bf{While this is only a 1.5$\\sigma$ detection, the results are in\nreasonable agreement with the predictions: the appearance of the companion at\nquadrature; the angular separation from Betelgeuse; the position angle with\nrespect to Betelgeuse; the magnitude difference; and the estimated mass of the\ncompanion.",

It summarizes the outcome of the nuclear astrophysics town meeting that was held on August 21-23, 2014 in College Station at the campus of Texas AM University in preparation of the NSAC Nuclear Science Long Range Plan. It also reflects the outcome of an earlier town meeting of the nuclear astrophysics community organized by the Joint Institute for Nuclear Astrophysics (JINA) on October 9-10, 2012 Detroit, Michigan, with the purpose of developing a vision for nuclear astrophysics in light of the recent NRC decadal surveys in nuclear physics (NP2010) and astronomy (ASTRO2010). The white paper is furthermore informed by the town meeting of the Association of Research at University Nuclear Accelerators (ARUNA) that took place at the University of Notre Dame on June 12-13, 2014. In summary we find that nuclear astrophysics is a modern and vibrant field addressing fundamental science questions at the intersection of nuclear physics and astrophysics. These questions relate to the origin of the elements, the nuclear engines that drive life and death of stars, and the properties of dense matter. A broad range of nuclear accelerator facilities, astronomical observatories, theory efforts, and computational capabilities are needed.

      "content": "A mercury-vapor lamp is a gas-discharge lamp that uses an electric arc through vaporized mercury to produce light. The arc discharge is generally confined to a small fused quartz arc tube mounted within a larger soda lime or borosilicate glass bulb. The outer bulb may be clear or coated with a phosphor; in either case, the outer bulb provides thermal insulation, protection from the ultraviolet radiation the light produces, and a convenient mounting for the fused quartz arc tube.\nMercury-vapor lamps are more energy efficient than incandescent lamps with luminous efficacies of 35 to 55 lumens/watt.  Their other advantages are a long bulb lifetime in the range of 24,000 hours and a high-intensity light output.  For these reasons, they are used for large area overhead lighting, such as in factories, warehouses, and sports arenas as well as for streetlights.  Clear mercury lamps produce a greenish light due to mercury's combination of spectral lines.  This is not flattering to human skin color, so such lamps are typically not used in retail stores.   \"Color corrected\" mercury bulbs overcome this problem with a phosphor on the inside of the outer bulb that emits at the red wavelengths, offering whiter light and better color rendition.\nMercury-vapor lights operate at an internal pressure of around one atmosphere and require special fixtures, as well as an electrical ballast.  They also require a warm-up period of four to seven minutes to reach full light output.  Mercury-vapor lamps are becoming obsolete due to the higher efficiency and better color balance of metal halide lamps.",

      "content": "Measuring proton-proton interaction cross-sections at center-of-mass energies\nabove 40 TeV remains a significant challenge in particle physics. The Pierre\nAuger Observatory provides a unique opportunity to study the interactions at\nthe highest energies through the distribution of the depth of maximum shower\ndevelopment ($X_\\mathrm{max}$) observed by its Fluorescence Detector. In\nprevious studies, the determination of the interaction cross-section at\nultrahigh energies has relied on the assumption that the tail of the\n$X_\\mathrm{max}$ distribution is proton-dominated, which restricts the analysis\nto a limited energy range below the ankle and introduces related systematic\nuncertainties. In this contribution, we adopt a novel method for the\nsimultaneous estimation of the proton-proton interaction cross-section and the\nprimary cosmic-ray mass composition using data from the Pierre Auger\nObservatory, avoiding assumptions about one quantity to infer the other and\nthus improving the accuracy and robustness of our analysis. In addition, a\nsystematic shift in the $X_\\mathrm{max}$ scale is fitted to account for both\nexperimental uncertainties and theoretical constraints on the modeling of\nparticle interactions. The obtained results are consistent with previous\nanalyses and provide additional constraints on hadronic interaction models. The\nmeasured proton-proton inelastic cross-section at ultra-high energies agrees\nwell with extrapolations of accelerator data.

In this context,\nwe have developed an extended Brown Hamiltonian in Paper I, which serves as a\nfundamental model for describing the modified von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai (ZLK)\noscillations. The present work aims to analyze the characteristics of ZLK\noscillations within this extended framework, focusing on phase-space\nstructures, the location of ZLK center, the maximum eccentricity reached, the\nboundaries of librating cycles, and the critical inclination required to\ntrigger ZLK resonance. Under the extended Hamiltonian, we introduce the Lidov\nintegral C_ZLK, which is a combination of the Hamiltonian and the z-component\nof angular momentum, to characterize the modified ZLK properties. It is found\nthat the librating and circulating cycles are separated by C_ZLK=0, which is\nconsistent with the classical theory. Furthermore, we derive analytical\nexpressions of these ZLK properties using perturbation techniques. Analytical\npredictions are compared to numerical results, showing an excellent agreement\nbetween them. Notably, the results reveal that ZLK characteristics in prograde\nand retrograde regimes are no longer symmetric under the influence of Brown\ncorrections. At last, we conduct $N$-body integrations about millions of orbits\nto generate dynamical maps, where the numerical structures are well captured by\nthe analytical solutions derived from the extended model.",

      "content": "In this work we study CO isotopologue emission in the largest cluster galaxy\nsample to date: 48 VERTICO spiral galaxies in Virgo. We show for the first time\nin a significant sample that the physical conditions within the molecular gas\nappear to change as a galaxy's ISM is affected by environmental processes. 13CO\nis detected across the sample, both directly and via stacking, while C18O is\ndetected in a smaller number of systems. We use these data to study trends with\nglobal and radial galaxy properties. We show that the CO/13CO line ratio\nchanges systematically with a variety of galaxy properties, including mean gas\nsurface density, HI-deficiency and galaxy morphology. 13CO/C18O line ratios\nvary significantly, both radially and between galaxies, suggesting real\nvariations in abundances are present. Such abundance changes may be due to star\nformation history differences, or speculatively even stellar initial mass\nfunction variations. We present a model where the optical depth of the\nmolecular gas appears to change as a galaxy's ISM is affected by environmental\nprocesses. The molecular gas appears to become more transparent as the\nmolecular medium is stripped, and then more opaque as the tightly bound remnant\ngas settles deep in the galaxy core. This explains the variations we see, and\nalso helps explain similar observations in cluster early-type galaxies. Next\ngeneration simulations and dedicated observations of additional isotopologues\ncould thus provide a powerful tool to help us understand the impact of\nenvironment on the ISM, and thus the quenching of galaxies.",

Following black hole formation, a neutrino-cooled, shocked\naccretion disk forms, which displays non-spherical oscillations for a period of\nseconds before becoming advective and exploding the star. We compute the\nneutrino and GW signals (matter quadrupole) from collapsar disks using global\naxisymmetric, viscous hydrodynamic simulations. The neutrino signal with\ntypical energies of O$(10)$ MeV is maximal during the neutrino-cooled (NDAF)\nphase that follows shock formation.

The GW signal during the NDAF phase is detectable in the galaxy by\ncurrent and next-generation ground-based observatories. The explosion (memory)\nGW signal is similar to that of standard core-collapse supernovae and can be\nprobed with a deci-Hertz space-based detector. Shock oscillations during the\nNDAF phase impart time variations with frequency O$(10-100)$ Hz to the neutrino\nand GW signals, encoding information about the shock dynamics and inner disk.\nThese time variations can be detectable in neutrinos by IceCube within\nO$(1-10)$ kpc depending on progenitor model, flavor transformation scenario,\nand detailed properties of the angular momentum transport mechanism.",

In stellar\npopulation synthesis, uncertainty in the mass-loss rates in these evolutionary\nstages limits our understanding of the formation of black holes and merging\ncompact binaries. In the last decade, the theoretical predictions, simulation,\nand direct observation of wind mass-loss rates in massive stars have improved\nsignificantly, typically leading to a reduction in the predicted mass-loss\nrates of massive stars. In this paper we explore the astrophysical implications\nof an updated treatment of winds in the COMPAS population synthesis code. There\nis a large amount of variation in predicted mass-loss rates for massive red\nsupergiants; some of the prescriptions we implement predict that massive red\nsupergiants are able to lose their hydrogen envelopes through winds alone\n(providing a possible solution to the so-called missing red supergiant\nproblem), while others predict much lower mass-loss rates that would not strip\nthe hydrogen envelope. We discuss the formation of the most massive\nstellar-mass black holes in the Galaxy, including the high-mass X-ray binary\nCygnus X-1 and the newly discovered Gaia BH3. We find that formation rates of\nmerging binary black holes are sensitive to the mass-loss rate prescriptions,\nwhile the formation rates of merging binary neutron stars and neutron-star\nblack hole binaries are more robust to this uncertainty.",

      "content": "Accurate soil moisture prediction during extreme events remains a critical\nchallenge for earth system modeling, with profound implications for drought\nmonitoring, flood forecasting, and climate adaptation strategies. While land\nsurface models (LSMs) provide physically-based predictions, they exhibit\nsystematic biases during extreme conditions when their parameterizations\noperate outside calibrated ranges. Here we present NoahMP-AI, a physics-guided\ndeep learning framework that addresses this challenge by leveraging the\ncomplete Noah-MP land surface model as a comprehensive physics-based feature\ngenerator while using machine learning to correct structural limitations\nagainst satellite observations. We employ a 3D U-Net architecture that\nprocesses Noah-MP outputs (soil moisture, latent heat flux, and sensible heat\nflux) to predict SMAP soil moisture across two contrasting extreme events: a\nprolonged drought (March-September 2022) and Hurricane Beryl (July 2024) over\nTexas. When comparing NoahMP-AI with NoahMP, our results demonstrate an\nincrease in R-squared values from -0.7 to 0.5 during drought conditions, while\nmaintaining physical consistency and spatial coherence. The framework's ability\nto preserve Noah-MP's physical relationships while learning observation-based\ncorrections represents a significant advance in hybrid earth system modeling.\nThis work establishes both a practical tool for operational forecasting and a\nbenchmark for investigating the optimal integration of physics-based\nunderstanding with data-driven learning in environmental prediction systems.",

Amongst the data from the Rosetta\nPlasma Consortium (RPC) suite of instruments are measurements of the total\nelectron density from the Mutual Impedance Probe (MIP) and Langmuir Probe\n(LAP).\n  At low outgassing, the plasma density measurements can be explained by a\nsimple balance between the production through ionisation and loss through\ntransport. Ions are assumed to travel radially at the outflow speed of the\nneutral gas. Near perihelion, the assumptions of this field-free chemistry-free\nmodel are no longer valid, and plasma density is overestimated. This can be\nexplained by enhanced ion transport by an ambipolar electric field inside the\ndiamagnetic cavity, where the interplanetary magnetic field does not reach.\n  In this study, we explore the transition between these two regimes, at\nintermediate outgassing ($5.4 \\times10^{26}~\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$), when the\ninteraction between the cometary and solar wind plasma influences the transport\nof the ions. We use a 3D collisional test-particle model, adapted from\nStephenson et al. 2022 to model the cometary ions with input electric and\nmagnetic fields from a hybrid simulation for 2.5-3 au. The total plasma density\nfrom this model is then compared to data from MIP/LAP and to the field-free\nchemistry-free model.

It is the sole species of the molossid genus Setirostris, a name that refers to the coarse bristles on their faces. Earlier common names have referred to this unique feature, and the 'free-tail' that is a common feature of its microchiropteran family, the Molossidae; no single common name emerged during the taxonomic revisions that identified what was referred to as the bristle-faced freetail.\nSetirostris eleryi differs from all other bats in the family by possessing unique dentition and genital morphology, a distinctive echolocation call structure, and notably smaller body size of around 5 grams (0.18 ounces). The presence of stout bristles on the thin muzzle and face of S. eleryi distinguishes them from similar genus Ozimops, once regarded as \"Mormopterus species\", that previously included parts of the population. The description, first published in 2008, emerged from a comparison of morphological features with an earlier phylogenetic analysis that had indicated cryptic species amongst this poorly-known group of bats.\nSetirostris eleryi may be widely distributed across inland Australia, ranging from very arid to moister subtropical regions. However, it is locally uncommon across its range, and only known to inhabit riparian zones and floodplains. During the day these bats roost in tree hollows of mature eucalypts, but are noted as squeezing themselves into other tiny crevices. They form colonies of up to twenty individuals, which often include bats of other species.",

Several hypervelocity white dwarfs (HVWDs)\nwith space velocities of $\\gtrsim 1000\\,\\mathrm{kms}^{-1}$ have recently been\ndiscovered. One possible origin of these stars is the dynamically-driven\ndouble-degenerate double-detonation (D6) scenario, in which an accreting\nsub-Chandrasekhar mass carbon-oxygen (CO) WD detonates as a SN Ia. In this\nscenario, the less massive WD may survive its companion's detonation and be\nejected as a HVWD. Most of the observed HVWDs are hotter and puffier than\nnormal WDs, perhaps due to their recent proximity to a SN. In this work, we\ntest whether these properties can be explained by long-lived stable carbon (C)\nburning in the interiors of CO WD donors triggered by a SN shock. We model the\nlong-term evolution of CO WDs following rapid energy injection using 1D models.\nWe find that stable C burning can be ignited in CO WDs with masses of $0.95 -\n1.10\\,M_{\\odot}$ if SN energy penetrates sufficiently deeply. The resulting\nborn-again stars settle on the C-burning main sequence while they convert their\ninteriors from C and O to Ne and Mg, where they have temperatures and radii\nsimilar to some of the observed HVWDs. However, the timescale over which\nC-burning WDs remain inflated is $\\lesssim 10^5\\,$yr, which is at least an\norder of magnitude shorter than the kinematic ages of observed hot HVWDs. We\nconclude that observed HVWDs are unlikely to be inflated by C burning. The\nstellar evolution of observed HVWDs remains an open problem.",

It was published and edited, from 1952 to 1959, by Peter Hamilton, a young Scot who was able to take advantage of spare capacity at his parents' printing company, Crownpoint, to launch the magazine.  Because Hamilton could only print Nebula when Crownpoint had no other work, the schedule was initially erratic.  In 1955 he moved the printing to a Dublin-based firm, and the schedule became a little more regular, with a steady monthly run beginning in 1958 that lasted into the following year.  Nebula's circulation was international, with only a quarter of the sales in the United Kingdom; this led to disaster when South Africa and Australia imposed import controls on foreign periodicals at the end of the 1950s.  Excise duties imposed in the UK added to Hamilton's financial burdens, and he was rapidly forced to close the magazine.  The last issue was dated June 1959.\nThe magazine was popular with writers, partly because Hamilton went to great lengths to encourage new writers, and partly because he paid better rates per word than much of his competition.  Initially he could not compete with the American market, but he offered a bonus for the most popular story in the issue, and was eventually able to match the leading American magazines.  He published the first stories of several well-known writers, including Robert Silverberg, Brian Aldiss, and Bob Shaw.  Nebula was also a fan favourite: author Ken Bulmer recalled that it became \"what many fans regard as the best-loved British SF magazine\".",

From the level of scientific conception to that of the scientific return, it is our understanding of the underlying processes that allows us to address fundamental questions regarding the origins and evolution of galaxies, stars, planetary systems, and life in the cosmos. In this regard, laboratory astrophysics is much like detector and instrument development at NASA and NSF; these efforts are necessary for the astronomical research being funded by the agencies. The NASA Laboratory Astrophysics Workshop met at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV) from 14-16 February, 2006 to identify the current laboratory data needed to support existing and future NASA missions and programs in the Astrophysics Division of the Science Mission Directorate (SMD). Here we refer to both laboratory and theoretical work as laboratory astrophysics unless a distinction is necessary. The format for the Workshop involved invited talks by users of laboratory data, shorter contributed talks and poster presentations by both users and providers that highlighted exciting developments in laboratory astrophysics, and breakout sessions where users and providers discussed each others' needs and limitations. We also note that the members of the Scientific Organizing Committee are users as well as providers of laboratory data. As in previous workshops, the focus was on atomic, molecular, and solid state physics.",

      "content": "Several large scale circulation patterns have been identified in relation to\nextreme Northern Hemisphere summer heatwaves. Three main ones are a double jet\nover Eurasia, a positive phase of the summer northern annular mode, and a\nquasi-wave-3 geopotential height anomaly. While there is some evidence\nsuggesting these patterns are related to each other, the explicit nature of\ntheir relation, as well as the explicit mechanisms by which they are related to\nextreme heatwaves is still not known. The double jet structure has gained\nattention recently due to evidence that its persistence has been increasing,\npossibly explaining the rise in the number of extreme heatwaves over Europe. In\nthis paper we study the occurrence and persistence of double jet states in ERA5\nand in stationary simulations with the CESM1.2 model, using an index which\nmeasures the degree of jet separation. Additionally, we perform simulations\nwith CESM1.2 coupled to a rare event algorithm in order to improve the\nstatistics of rare summer-long double jet states. We find that extreme double\njet states are characterised by three centers of extreme high surface\ntemperature and 500hPa geopotential height anomalies, alongside a strong low\npressure over the Arctic. The geopotential height anomaly pattern is consistent\nwith both a positive Northern Annular Mode (NAM) and quasi-wave-3 patterns\nfound in the literature. Moreover, we find a large percentage of co-occurrence\nof heatwaves at these centers, and a double jet state, with the percentage\nincreasing with the duration of the double jet state.",

In these procedures it is\ncommon to adopt a Gaussian likelihood. However, this implicitly assumes that\nthe upper and lower error bars on the spectral points are equal. With recent\nobservations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) offering higher quality\nof data, it is worth revisiting this assumption to understand the impact that\nan asymmetry between the error bars may have on retrieved parameters. In this\nstudy, we challenge the approximation by comparing retrievals using a\nsymmetric, Gaussian likelihood, and an asymmetric, split normal likelihood. We\nfind that the influence of this assumption is minimal at the scales of\nasymmetry observed in JWST observations of WASP-39 b (with a maximum asymmetry\nof 77%) but we show that it would become critical with greater levels of\nasymmetry (e.g. an average asymmetry of 80%). Furthermore, we stress the\nimportance of the shape of the asymmetric distribution and the difficulty in\nfitting this distribution from three summary statistics (the median and an\nupper and lower bound on the transit depth). An asymmetric likelihood sampler\nwill incorrectly predict parameters if the shape of the likelihood does not\nmatch that of the underlying noise distribution even when the levels of\nasymmetry are equal in both. Overall, we find that it is safe to use the\nGaussian likelihood assumption for current datasets but it is worth considering\nthe potential bias if greater asymmetries are observed.",

PSR J0007+7303, a very bright\ngamma-ray pulsar, is the first pulsar discovered by the Fermi-LAT telescope. In\nthis paper, we present the 15 years of timing results of this pulsar using the\nFermi-LAT data. We identified nine glitches, five of which are newly\ndiscovered. Among these, two are small glitches, occurring between the three\npreviously reported ones, while the other four are large glitches. The glitches\nexhibit fractional frequency changes ranging from 15 x 10^-9 to 1238 x 10^-9,\nwith intervals of approximately 1-2 years between events. Uniquely, this pulsar\nshows no exponential recovery behavior following any glitch, setting it apart\nfrom most glitching pulsars. Furthermore, no significant changes were observed\nin the gamma-ray pulse profile, flux, or phase-averaged spectra before and\nafter glitches, indicating the stability of the pulsar's emission properties\ndespite internal changes. A parametric analysis of the glitches yielded a\nfractional moment of inertia of the crustal superfluid involved in glitches as\n1.06 percent, which matches extremely well with previous statistical work if\nthe non-dissipative entrainment effect is not considered and strongly supports\nthe internal origin of these glitches. These results highlight the distinct\nglitch behavior of PSR J0007+7303 and offer valuable insights into the\ncrust-superfluid interaction in neutron stars.

By measuring the surface\nbrightness profile of the coma, we determined that the comet maintained nearly\nin a steady state during the observations. Analysis of the dust distribution\nperpendicular to the orbital plane reveals that the ejection velocity is\n$v_{\\perp}\\sim(65\\pm5)\\,\\beta^{1/2}$ m s$^{-1}$, where $\\beta$ is inversely\nproportional to the size of the dust grains. From the dust scattering\ncross-section measurement, we estimated the upper limit of the nucleus radius\nto be $\\sim\\!5.9\\pm0.2$ km, assuming a geometric albedo of 0.04.

      "content": "Magnetic reconnection in current layers that form intermittently in\nradiatively inefficient accretion flows onto black holes is a promising\nmechanism for particle acceleration and high-energy emission. It has been\nrecently proposed that such layers, arising during flux eruption events, can\npower the rapid TeV flares observed from the core of M87. In this scenario,\ninverse Compton scattering of soft radiation from the accretion flow by\nenergetic electron-positron pairs produced near the reconnection layer was\nsuggested as the primary emission mechanism. However, detailed calculations\nshow that radiation from pairs alone cannot account for the GeV emission\ndetected by the Fermi observatory. In this work, we combine analytic estimates\nwith 3D radiative particle-in-cell simulations of pair-proton plasmas to show\nthat the GeV emission can be naturally explained by synchrotron radiation from\nprotons accelerated in the current sheet. Although the exact proton content of\nthe layer is uncertain, our model remains robust across a broad range of\nproton-to-pair number density ratios. While protons are subdominant in number\ncompared to pairs, our simulations demonstrate that they can be accelerated\nmore efficiently, leading to a self-regulated steady state in which protons\ndominate the energy budget. Ultimately, proton synchrotron emission accounts\nfor approximately 5% to 20% of the total dissipation power. The majority is\nradiated as MeV photons via pair synchrotron emission, with a smaller fraction\nemitted as TeV photons through inverse Compton scattering.",

In this paper, we examine 399 candidate\nsingle late-M dwarfs with $G - G_{RP} \\geq 1.4$ mag ($\\gtrsim$M6) using TESS\nlight curves. To determine rotation periods, we employed Lomb-Scargle\nPeriodograms to provide a first estimate of the period, then refined them with\na Gaussian Process approach, requiring multi-sector confirmation when\navailable. We found 133 rotation periods, ranging from 2 hours to 6 days, and\namplitudes between 0.08% and 2.71%. We find that the observed variability\nfraction in late-M dwarfs rises with the number of available TESS sectors,\napproaching an apparent ceiling of ~50%. This likely reflects a detection limit\ndetermined by viewing geometry and supports the idea that spot-induced\nvariability is common across the late-M and brown dwarf population. In our\ncomparison with previously published late-M dwarf rotation periods reported, we\nfound consistent results, confirming or updating 31 periods. Our findings\nexpand the number of previously known late-M dwarf periods under 1 day by 76%.\nCombined with published rotation periods for a broader range of spectral types,\nwe find a lower envelope on the rotation period decreasing from 5 hours at\nearly-M dwarfs to 1 hour at L, T, and Y dwarfs.",

The strongest associations suggest a\ncorrelation between neutrinos and active galactic nuclei (AGN). However, it is\nstill unclear which specific regions and mechanisms of the accreting\nsupermassive black hole (SMBH) are responsible for their production. In this\npaper we investigate the correlation between the positions of IceCat-1 neutrino\nevents and a large, optically selected QSO catalog extracted from the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey. Within this sample, we distinguish radio-quiet QSOs from\nflat-spectrum radio QSOs (FSRQs)based on radio emission data from the Cosmic\nLens All Sky Survey (CLASS) catalog. While the associations between neutrino\nevents and radio-quiet QSOs are consistent with being all random matches, FSRQs\nexhibit a moderately significant correlation (2.7 sigma) with neutrino\npositions. Additionally we observe that the distribution of minimum distances\nbetween neutrino events and FSRQs differs significantly for events at\ndeclinations above and below 20 deg. In particular, using the KS test, we find\nthat the high-declination event distribution shows a strong deviation (4 sigma)\nfrom a random distribution. We interpret all these results as an indication\nthat a large fraction (> 60%) of the neutrino events observed by IceCube could\nbe produced by the FSRQ and that the emission mechanism is likely related to\nthe relativistic jets rather than the \"radio-quiet\" (RQ) component of these\nsources, such as the accretion disk or corona.",

The angular profile of GRB jets\nencodes important information about their launching and propagation near the\ncentral source, and can be probed through their afterglow emission. Detailed\nanalysis of the multi-wavelength afterglow light curves of recent GRBs indeed\nshows evidence for an extended angular structure beyond the jet's narrow core.\nThe afterglow emission is determined by the jet angular structure, our viewing\nangle, and the magnetic field structure behind the shock, often leading to\ndegeneracies when considering the light curves and broad-band spectrum alone.\nSuch degeneracies can be lifted with joint modeling of the afterglow light\ncurves and polarization. In this work we study the evolution of the afterglow\nlinear polarization and flux density from steep, core-dominated GRB jets, where\nmost of their energy resides within a narrow core. We explore the dependence of\nthe light and polarization curves on the viewing angle, jet angular energy\nstructure and magnetic field configuration, and provide an analytical\napproximation for the peak polarization level, which occurs at a time close to\nthat of a break in the light curve.

      "content": "Space Race is an arcade game developed by Atari, Inc. and released on July 16, 1973. It was the second game by the company, after Pong (1972), which marked the beginning of the commercial video game industry along with the Magnavox Odyssey. In the game, two players each control a rocket ship, with the goal of being the first to move their ship from the bottom of the screen to the top. Along the way are asteroids, which the players must avoid. Space Race was the first racing arcade video game and the first game with a goal of crossing the screen while avoiding obstacles.\nDevelopment of Space Race began in Summer 1972 under the name Asteroid by Atari co-founder Nolan Bushnell, based on ideas by him and co-founder Ted Dabney. The final design was done by Dabney, possibly with assistance by Bushnell and Pong designer Allan Alcorn. The game was planned to be quick to create to fulfill an earlier contract with Midway Manufacturing. The engineering and prototyping was done by Alcorn; after it was completed and the design given to Midway to be released as Asteroid, Atari produced its own nearly identical version as Space Race. Fifty Space Race cabinets were produced using a fiberglass design by George Faraco before the rest of the production was switched to a cheaper standard cabinet.\nSpace Race was not commercially successful; Bushnell said that it was much less popular than Pong. Midway held that the release of Space Race violated Atari's contract with them for Asteroid, and the companies agreed for Atari to forfeit royalty payments for the game.",

This report presents an analysis of light\npollution data from the washetdonker.nl SQM network from 2020 until 2023, with\na focus on indirect light pollution, commonly known as skyglow. By integrating\nmeasurements from Sky Quality Meter (SQM) stations in the network and cloud\ncover data from EUMETSAT, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of night sky\nbrightness across a region encompassing northern Netherlands and the western\npart of the German Wadden Coast. Yearly changes in brightness for 27 locations\nwere ranked and plotted, revealing that in the darkest areas, light pollution\nis increasing at a rate of 2.78 to 6.68 percent per year. A trend emerged\nshowing that brighter areas experienced lower variability in brightness, while\ndarker zones exhibited higher variability. This is due to the dominance of\nartificial light sources, such as street lighting, in brighter areas, which\nreduces the influence of natural light sources like the Moon, stars, and cloud\nbackscatter. Seasonal patterns and the effects of the Milky Way were also\ninvestigated. Density plots were employed to visualize these changes in night\nsky brightness, helping to identify specific sources of light pollution, such\nas greenhouse lighting and streetlight turn-off times.

Downstream of the shock between the stellar winds there exists a\nsuitable environment for dust grain formation, and the orbital motion of the\nstars wraps this dust into richly structured spiral geometries. The Apep system\nis the most extreme WR-CWB in our Milky Way: two WR stars produce a complex\nspiral dust nebula, whose slow expansion has been linked to a gamma-ray burst\nprogenitor. It has been unclear whether the O-type supergiant 0.7\" distant from\nthe WR+WR binary is physically associated with the system, and whether it\naffects the dusty nebula. Multi-epoch VLT/VISIR and JWST/MIRI observations show\nthat this northern companion star routinely carves a cavity in the dust nebula\n- the first time such an effect has been observed in a CWB - which\nunambiguously associates the O star as a bound component to the Apep system.\nThese observations are used together with a new geometric model to infer the\ncavity geometry and the orbit of the WR+WR binary, yielding the first strong\nconstraints on wind and orbital parameters. We confirm an orbital period of\nover 190 years for the inner binary - nearly an order of magnitude longer than\nthe next longest period dust-producing WR-CWB.

Here, we show\nthat conditions frequently arise in coastal marine settings where these\nassumptions do not hold. Using flux measurements from the Coastal Land-Air-Sea\nInteraction (CLASI) project's Air-Sea Interaction Spar (ASIS) buoys with wind\nand flux measurements at typically ~3m and ~5m above the sea surface, we find\nthat wind speed decreases with height in nearly 20% of observations, and that\nlarge vertical gradients in sensible heat flux occur near the surface, contrary\nto what would be predicted by MOST.

These patterns were found using the Discovery\nEngine, a general-purpose automated system for scientific discovery, which\nidentifies complex relationships in data without prior hypotheses.

To\ndetermine accurate masses and orbital parameters for planets g and h, we\ncombined 34 radial velocities (RVs) of Kepler-90, collected over a decade, with\nthe Kepler transit data.

These forces are primarily of three types: propulsive force provided by the vehicle's engines; gravitational force exerted by the Earth and other celestial bodies; and aerodynamic lift and drag (when flying in the atmosphere of the Earth or other body, such as Mars or Venus).\nThe principles of flight dynamics are used to model a vehicle's powered flight during launch from the Earth; a spacecraft's orbital flight; maneuvers to change orbit; translunar and interplanetary flight; launch from and landing on a celestial body, with or without an atmosphere; entry through the atmosphere of the Earth or other celestial body; and attitude control. They are generally programmed into a vehicle's inertial navigation systems, and monitored on the ground by a member of the flight controller team known in NASA as the flight dynamics officer, or in the European Space Agency as the spacecraft navigator.\nFlight dynamics depends on the disciplines of propulsion, aerodynamics, and astrodynamics (orbital mechanics and celestial mechanics). It cannot be reduced to simply attitude control; real spacecraft do not have steering wheels or tillers like airplanes or ships. Unlike the way fictional spaceships are portrayed, a spacecraft actually does not bank to turn in outer space, where its flight path depends strictly on the gravitational forces acting on it and the propulsive maneuvers applied.",

Motivated by this, we investigate the influence of\nfermionic asymmetric dark matter (ADM) on the equilibrium structure of\nprogenitor cores and the formation of their neutron star remnants. Using a\ngeneral relativistic two-fluid formalism, we model the coupled evolution of\nordinary matter (OM) and ADM, treated as separately conserved fluids\ninteracting solely through gravity. Our analysis focuses on neon-rich white\ndwarfs (Ne WDs), which are typical progenitor cores for ECSNe. We assume\nconservation of both baryon number ($N_B$) and dark matter particle number\n($N_D$) during collapse, allowing for a consistent mapping between progenitor\nand remnant configurations. We find that ADM significantly enhances the central\ndensity of the WD progenitor. This lowers the threshold gravitational mass\n$M^*$ required to initiate electron capture, enabling ECSNe from lower-mass\nprogenitors. The resulting remnants are stable, dark matter-admixed neutron\nstars with gravitational masses potentially well below current observational\nbounds. Moreover, we find that the conversion energy during the WD-to-NS\nconversion is also significantly reduced for higher ADM particle masses and\nfractions, suggesting that unusually low-energy ECSNe may serve as potential\nindicators of ADM involvement in stellar collapse.",

Additionally, this wave interacts with three filaments\n(F1, F2, and F3) along its path, inducing oscillation with multiple amplitudes:\nFilaments F1 and F2 exhibit simultaneous horizontal and vertical large-scale\noscillations ($\\sim$\\speed{20}), while Filament F3 only exhibits vertical\nsmall-scale oscillation ($\\sim$\\speed{4}).

We utilize an artificial\nneural network approach to match the SN and BAO data at the same redshift.

      "title": "Quantifying Resolution Limits in Pedestal Profile Measurements with\n  Gaussian Process Regression",
      "content": "Edge transport barriers (ETBs) in magnetically confined fusion plasmas,\ncommonly known as pedestals, play a crucial role in achieving high confinement\nplasmas. However, their defining characteristic, a steep rise in plasma\npressure over short length scales, makes them challenging to diagnose\nexperimentally. In this work, we use Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to\ndevelop first-principles metrics for quantifying the spatiotemporal resolution\nlimits of inferring differentiable profiles of temperature, pressure, or other\nquantities from experimental measurements. Although we focus on pedestals, the\nmethods are fully general and can be applied to any setting involving the\ninference of profiles from discrete measurements. First, we establish a\ncorrespondence between GPR and low-pass filtering, giving an explicit\nexpression for the effective `cutoff frequency' associated with smoothing\nincurred by GPR. Second, we introduce a novel information-theoretic metric,\n\\(N_{eff}\\), which measures the effective number of data points contributing to\nthe inferred value of a profile or its derivative. These metrics enable a\nquantitative assessment of the trade-off between `over-fitting' and\n`over-regularization', providing both practitioners and consumers of GPR with a\nsystematic way to evaluate the credibility of inferred profiles. We apply these\ntools to develop practical advice for using GPR in both time-independent and\ntime-dependent settings, and demonstrate their usage on inferring pedestal\nprofiles using measurements from the DIII-D tokamak.",

Despite significant\nadvancements in this technique, it is limited by the intrinsic mass-inclination\ndegeneracy that can be broken when combining RVs with astrometry, which allows\nus to determine the orbital inclination, or direct imaging, from which we can\nestimate the true mass of the target. HD 72659 is a solar analog known to host\na gas giant on a $\\sim 10$-yr orbit and a massive outer companion. This work\naims to confirm HD 72659 c, which was recently announced using data from HIRES\nand HARPS spectrographs in combination with Gaia's astrometric data. We\nmonitored HD 72659 with HARPS-N in the framework of the GAPS project since\n2012.

Moreover, we analyzed our high-resolution imaging observation taken\nwith SPHERE, but since the target was not detected, we could only derive upper\nlimits on its mass. We characterize the orbital parameters of HD 72659 c,\nconfirming the literature mass of this object but finding a period twice as\nhigh as previously reported, and we also refine the parameters of planet b with\nreduced uncertainties compared to previous works.

JUICE carries a\nradiation monitor, namely the RADiation hard Electron Monitor (RADEM) to\nmeasure protons, electrons, and ions, detecting particles coming mainly from\nthe anti-Sun direction. On 2024 May 13, a large solar energetic particle (SEP)\nevent took place in association with an eruption close to the western limb of\nthe Sun as seen from Earth. Providentially, at that time JUICE was located very\nclose to STEREO-A, being separated by 0.13 au in radial distance, 0.3 deg in\nlatitude, and 1.6 deg in longitude. Methods. We analysed the IP context using\nin-situ measurements and studied the proton anisotropies measured by near-Earth\nspacecraft and STEREO-A. We focused on an isotropic period during the decay\nphase of the SEP event to compute the proton energy spectrum. We fit the\nSTEREO-A spectrum and compared it to that measured by SOHO and JUICE.\nConclusions. The RADEM instrument aboard JUICE is a valuable tool for measuring\nSEP events in the heliosphere, providing an excellent opportunity to study and\ncharacterise the energetic particle environment in the solar wind between 0.65\nand 5.2 au.

Such black holes, if they existed in the Milky Way\nhalo, would give rise to long-duration microlensing events that may potentially\nlast for years. However, earlier searches were not sufficiently sensitive to\ndetect such events. Here, we present the results of searches for long-timescale\ngravitational microlensing events toward the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) using\nnearly 20 years of photometric observations collected by the Optical\nGravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) from 2001 to 2020.

Beyond the standard Michelson configuration, a variety of\nsecond-generation TDI schemes have been proposed, each utilizing different\ncombinations of inter-spacecraft laser links. In this work, we conduct a\ncomparative study of several representative TDI configurations with varying\ntime spans and demonstrate that their (quasi-)orthogonal channels are highly\ncorrelated, indicating substantial redundancy among these schemes. In the\nlow-frequency regime, the performance of different TDI configurations are\nnearly identical. Their distinctions emerge primarily at high frequencies,\nwhere the GW wavelength becomes comparable to the arm length. In this regime,\nshorter TDI time spans with minimal null frequencies facilitate more accurate\nwaveform modeling and parameter recovery in frequency domain. In contrast,\nconfigurations with longer time spans and more null frequencies, such as the\nMichelson, are more susceptible to frequency aliasing and waveform modulation\neffects, which degrade inference accuracy. However, if signal modeling and\nanalysis are performed in the time domain, all TDI configurations become\neffectively equivalent.

Engineering controls are preferred over administrative controls and personal protective equipment (PPE) because they are designed to remove the hazard at the source, before it comes in contact with the worker. Well-designed engineering controls can be highly effective in protecting workers and will typically be independent of worker interactions to provide this high level of protection. The initial cost of engineering controls can be higher than the cost of administrative controls or PPE, but over the longer term, operating costs are frequently lower, and in some instances, can provide a cost savings in other areas of the process.\nElimination and substitution are usually considered to be separate levels of hazard controls, but in some schemes they are categorized as types of engineering control.\nThe U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health researches engineering control technologies, and provides information on their details and effectiveness in the NIOSH Engineering Controls Database.",

All realisations share\nthe same initial conditions and code parameters, but draw different random\nnumbers for the inherently stochastic parts of the model.

Earlier geological investigations consistently suggested\nthat major geological processes might not occur on Apophis during this closest\nencounter, including surface processing and interior deformation. However,\nminor resurfacing may occur, depending on local geological conditions. A\ncritical finding is that the rotational evolution occurs due to the tidal\neffect from the Earth. The present study offers an additional perspective on\nthe rotational evolution, which may vary due to variations in interior\nproperties.

The catalogue covers a circular region of $10deg^2$\nand includes 23309 radio sources with a peak signal-to-noise ratio greater than\n5. After masking regions close to stars and with unreliable photometry in the\noptical or near-infrared, the catalogue includes 19550 sources. To carry out a\nrobust identification strategy, we combined the statistical power of the\nLikelihood Ratio (LR) method, including both colour and magnitude information,\nwith targeted visual inspection. The resulting catalogue boasts a remarkable\nidentification rate of 99.2%, successfully matching 19401 out of 19550 radio\nsources with reliable optical and/or near-infrared counterparts. For 19391 of\nthe matched sources, we successfully derived photometric redshift for the host\ngalaxy by performing an SED fit using the available data in the optical,\nnear-infrared, far-infrared, and radio. LOFAR sources within the catalogue\nexhibit a median redshift of 1.1, with some extending up to z=6. Around 7% of\nthe sample is detected only in infrared using IRAC and tends towards higher\nredshifts, with a median of z=3.0. This comprehensive catalogue serves as a\nvaluable resource for future research, enabling detailed investigations into\nthe properties and evolution of LOFAR-detected sources and their host galaxies.",

Appearing as\ndark, tendril-like downflows above growing flare loop arcades, SADs themselves\nare yet to be tied into the standard model of solar flares. The uncertainty of\ntheir origin is, in part, due to a lack of spectral observations, with the last\npublished SAD spectral observations dating back to the Solar and Heliospheric\nObservatory / Solar Ultraviolet Measurements of Emitted Radiation (SOHO/SUMER)\nera in 2003.

As part of NASA's Explorer program, NICER enabled rotation-resolved spectroscopy of the thermal and non-thermal emissions of neutron stars in the soft X-ray (0.2–12 keV) band with unprecedented sensitivity, probing interior structure, the origins of dynamic phenomena, and the mechanisms that underlie the most powerful cosmic particle accelerators known. NICER achieved these goals by deploying, following the launch, and activation of X-ray timing and spectroscopy instruments. NICER was selected by NASA to proceed to formulation phase in April 2013.\nNICER-SEXTANT uses the same instrument to test X-ray timing for positioning and navigation, and MXS is a test of X-ray timing communication. In January 2018, X-ray navigation was demonstrated using NICER on ISS.\nIn May 2023, NICER's thermal shields developed a leak that allowed stray light to enter the telescope.

Using this, we assembled the largest sample to date: 441\nFSRQs and 464 SSRQs with suitable optical spectra to study both strong\nabsorbers and weak (0.3 A < W_r(2796) < 1.0 A) Mg II absorbers. We conducted a\ndetailed comparison of absorbers' incidence rate and offset velocity\ndistributions. Our main findings are: (i) For both weak and strong absorbers,\nwe found no significant excess in dN/dz towards FSRQ compared to SSRQ\nsightlines. (ii) The dN/dbeta distribution of Mg II absorbers along FSRQs and\nSSRQs are statistically similar. (iii) The cumulative distribution of weak Mg\nII absorbers is slightly lower for beta < 0.3, but shows an excess at higher\nbeta. This suggests that, while intrinsic Mg II absorber abundance is\ncomparable along both sightlines, FSRQs' more aligned relativistic jets cluster\nweak absorbers at high beta, consistent with the scenario of jet-driven\nacceleration of smaller gas clumps.",

We find that the effect of cohesion on the\nimpact behavior becomes more significant in smaller gravitational acceleration,\nraising the need to scale the cohesion coefficient with gravity. We find that\ndue to an insufficient understanding of confounding between cohesion and\nfriction-induced quasi-static and inertial resistance, the outcomes of the DEM\nsimulation models are incongruent with a suggested analytic model using Froude\nand Bond number scaling based on an additive contribution of frictional and\ninertial forces.

      "content": "The solar wind is a stream of charged particles released from the Sun's outermost atmospheric layer, the corona. This plasma mostly consists of electrons, protons and alpha particles with kinetic energy between 0.5 and 10 keV. The composition of the solar wind plasma also includes a mixture of particle species found in the solar plasma: trace amounts of heavy ions and atomic nuclei of elements such as carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, neon, magnesium, silicon, sulfur, and iron. There are also rarer traces of some other nuclei and isotopes such as phosphorus, titanium, chromium, and nickel's isotopes 58Ni, 60Ni, and 62Ni. Superimposed with the solar-wind plasma is the interplanetary magnetic field. The solar wind varies in density, temperature and speed over time and over solar latitude and longitude. Its particles can escape the Sun's gravity because of their high energy resulting from the high temperature of the corona, which in turn is a result of the coronal magnetic field. The boundary separating the corona from the solar wind is called the Alfvén surface.\nAt a distance of more than a few solar radii from the Sun, the solar wind reaches speeds of 250–750 km/s and is supersonic, meaning it moves faster than the speed of fast magnetosonic waves. The flow of the solar wind is no longer supersonic at the termination shock. Other related phenomena include the aurora (northern and southern lights), comet tails that always point away from the Sun, and geomagnetic storms that can change the direction of magnetic field lines.",

It was released in April 1998 for Microsoft Windows and in March 1999 for Apple Macintosh. The game takes place on the eponymous starship, which the player is tasked with repairing by locating the missing parts of its control system. The gameplay involves solving puzzles and speaking with the bots inside the ship. The game features a text parser similar to those of text adventure games with which the player can talk with characters.\nWritten and designed by The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy creator Douglas Adams, Starship Titanic began development in 1996 and took two years to develop. In order to achieve Adams's goal of being able to converse with characters in the game, his company developed a language processor to interpret players' input and give an appropriate response and recorded over 16 hours of character dialogue. Oscar Chichoni and Isabel Molina, artists on the film Restoration (1995), served as the game's production designers and designed the ship's Art Deco visuals. The game's voice cast includes Monty Python members Terry Jones and John Cleese. A tie-in novel titled Douglas Adams's Starship Titanic: A Novel was written by Jones and released in October 1997.\nStarship Titanic was released to mixed reviews and was a financial disappointment, although it was nominated for three industry awards and won a Codie award in 1999. It was re-released for modern PCs in September 2015 by GOG.com.",

Here we revisit a recent variant of the Newman-Janis-Azreg-Ainou\nalgorithm, restricted to asymptotically-flat spacetimes, and demonstrate that\nthis method exclusively generates Konoplya-Stuchlik-Zhidenko spacetimes.\nTherefore, the equations for geodesic motion and scalar-wave propagation are\nboth separable. We call these \"doubly separable\" spacetimes. We identify a\nsubclass of the spacetimes that might admit a separable Dirac equation by\nexplicitly obtaining the Killing-Yano tensor. The high degree of symmetry in\nthese spacetimes suggests that the self-gravitating matter must also be in\nspecialized field configurations. For this reason, we investigate whether these\nspacetimes can even be sourced by arbitrary types of matter. We show that\ndoubly separable spacetimes cannot be sourced by massless real scalar fields or\nperfect fluids, and that electromagnetic fields lead only to the Kerr-Newman\nfamily. Notably, this rules out the elusive spinning counterpart of the\nJanis-Newman-Winicour naked singularity spacetime, which contains a scalar\nfield, as a member of this metric class.

The red pigment vermilion is obtained by grinding natural cinnabar or synthetic mercuric sulfide. Exposure to mercury and mercury-containing organic compounds is toxic to the nervous system, immune system and kidneys of humans and other animals; mercury poisoning can result from exposure to water-soluble forms of mercury (such as mercuric chloride or methylmercury) either directly or through mechanisms of biomagnification.\nMercury is used in thermometers, barometers, manometers, sphygmomanometers, float valves, mercury switches, mercury relays, fluorescent lamps and other devices, although concerns about the element's toxicity have led to the phasing out of such mercury-containing instruments. It remains in use in scientific research applications and in amalgam for dental restoration in some locales. It is also used in fluorescent lighting.

      "title": "Physical parameter regression from black hole images via a multiscale\n  adaptive neural network",
      "content": "High-precision regression of physical parameters from black hole images\ngenerated by General Relativistic Ray Tracing (GRRT) is essential for\ninvestigating spacetime curvature and advancing black hole astrophysics.\nHowever, due to limitations in observational resolution, high observational\ncosts, and imbalanced distributions of positive and negative samples, black\nhole images often suffer from data scarcity, sparse parameter spaces, and\ncomplex structural characteristics. These factors pose significant challenges\nto conventional regression methods based on simplified physical models. To\novercome these challenges, this study introduces Multiscale Adaptive Network\n(MANet) , a novel regression framework grounded in deep learning. MANet\nintegrates an Adaptive Channel Attention (ACA) module to selectively enhance\nfeatures in physically informative regions. Meanwhile, a Multiscale Enhancement\nFeature Pyramid (MEFP) is employed to capture fine-grained spatial structures\nsuch as photon rings and accretion disks, while alleviating information loss\ndue to downsampling. Experimental evaluations on GRRT-simulated datasets\ndemonstrate that MANet substantially improves parameter estimation accuracy and\ngeneralization capability in high-dimensional parameter spaces, outperforming\nexisting baseline approaches. This framework presents a promising avenue for\nhigh-precision parameter regression in Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) data\nanalysis and broader astrophysical imaging applications characterized by sparse\nand noisy data.",

      "content": "The quark mixing (CKM) matrix is near-diagonal, whereas the lepton mixing\n(PMNS) matrix is not. We learn that both observations can generically be\nexplained within an ultraviolet completion of the Standard Model with gravity.\nWe find that certain relations between CKM matrix elements should hold\napproximately because of asymptotically safe regimes, including\n$|V_{ud}|^2+|V_{us}|^2 \\approx 1$ and $|V_{cd}|^2+|V_{cs}|^2\\approx 1$.\nTheoretically, the accuracies of these relations determine the length of the\nasymptotically safe regimes. Experimental data confirms these relations with an\naccuracy of $10^{-5}$ and $10^{-3}$, respectively. This difference in\naccuracies is also expected, because the ultraviolet completion consists in a\nfixed-point cascade during which one relation is established already much\ndeeper in the ultraviolet. This results in $|V_{ub}|^2 < |V_{cb}|^2$ and\ntranslates into measurable properties of $B$-mesons.\n  Similar results would hold for the PMNS matrix, if neutrino Yukawa couplings\nwere large. The ultraviolet complete theory therefore must -- and in fact can\n-- avoid such an outcome. It contains a mechanism that dynamically limits the\nsize of neutrino Yukawa couplings. Below an upper bound on the sum of Dirac\nneutrino masses, this allows the PMNS matrix to avoid a near-diagonal structure\nlike the CKM matrix. Thus, large neutrino mixing is intimately tied to small\nDirac neutrino masses, $\\sum m_{\\nu} \\lesssim {\\mathcal{O}} (1)\\, \\rm eV$ and a\nmass gap in the Standard Model fermion masses.",

      "content": "Because aerosol-cloud interactions are the most uncertain climate forcing in\nthe Earth system, it is important to better understand the aerosol-cloud\ninteractions, especially how they will change with climate. This study carries\nout large eddy simulations (LES) of a 3-day stratocumulus-to-cumulus transition\n(SCT) along an airmass-following trajectory in the Northeast Pacific Ocean. By\nperturbing aerosol concentrations within the marine boundary layer (MBL) in the\nSCT simulations, we evaluate aerosol-cloud interactions in both the present day\nas well as in a double-CO2 climate. We find that aerosol-induced cloud changes,\nincluding first (Twomey effect) and second adjustments of cloud fraction and\nliquid water path (LWP) indirect effects of aerosols, tend to be inhibited in a\ndouble-CO2 climate. The LWP adjustment is more sensitive to global warming than\nthe Twomey effect. By decomposing the aerosol-induced cloud radiative effect\nchange ($\\Delta$CRE), we find that the aerosol-induced cloud fraction change\n($\\Delta$CF) shows the largest contribution to $\\Delta$CRE in our simulations.\nAerosol-induced droplet number concentration change ($\\Delta$Nc) shows a\ncooling effect, while the LWP change shows a warming effect that is consistent\nwith aerosol-induced cloud thinning. Overall, the cooling effect associated\nwith increased aerosol concentrations will weaken in a double-CO2 climate.

      "content": "Cosmic voids have emerged as powerful probes for cosmology, providing\ncomplementary information on the large-scale structure of the universe. We\npresent the first application of a hydrodynamical framework to model the\nevolution of cosmic voids. This approach offers a physically intuitive\ncharacterization of void dynamics and can naturally be applied to non-standard\ncosmologies. We derive the cosmology-dependent mapping that relates the linear\n(Lagrangian) and fully non-linear (Eulerian) evolution of the matter density\ncontrast, a central component for accurate theoretical modeling of void\nstatistics. Furthermore, we present a new method for determining the\nshell-crossing epoch across arbitrary cosmological backgrounds, thereby\nextending previous treatments restricted to the Einstein-de Sitter universe.\n  Motivated by recent DESI results hinting at dynamical dark energy, we\ninvestigate void evolution in $ w_0w_a$CDM cosmologies by varying $ w_0$ and\n$w_a$. We also consider the impact of varying the matter density parameter, $\n\\Omega_{\\mathrm{m},0}$. We find that the evolution of isolated, spherically\nsymmetric cosmic voids is most sensitive to $ \\Omega_{\\mathrm{m},0} $ and $ w_0\n$, which can alter the non-linear density contrast by up to 20-30%. Variations\nin $w_a$ have a smaller impact, but may still lead to measurable effects.

The PK-4 experiment uses video\ncameras to track individual dust particles, which allows for the collection of\nlarge amounts of statistical information on the dust particle positions and\nvelocities. In Part One of this paper, these statistics were used to quantify\nanomalous dust diffusion caused by anisotropies in the plasma-mediated\ndust-dust interactions in PK-4. Here we use scaling relations to convert\nstatistical parameters extracted from data into input parameters for a\nHamiltonian spectral model. The kinetic energy term of the Hamiltonian\n(modeling anomalous diffusion) is informed from the dust displacement\ndistribution functions, while the potential energy term (modeling\nstochasticity) is informed from fluctuations in the dust positions. The\nspectrum of energy states for each Hamiltonian is studied to assess probability\nfor extended states (i.e., a continuous portion of the spectrum). The spectral\nmodel shows that the combination of nonlocality and stochasticity leads to high\nprobability for transport at certain scales in Hilbert space, which coincide\nwith the characteristic spatial scales of dust particle jumps observed in the\nexperiments.

Recent\nmicrolensing surveys have discovered several free-floating planets that are not\nbound to any known stellar systems. Additionally, three interstellar objects,\nnamely 1I/'Oumuamua, 2I/Borisov, and 3I/ATLAS, have been detected passing\nthrough our solar system on hyperbolic trajectories.

Although no statistically\nsignificant events were detected, this non-detection enables us to place upper\nlimits on the number density of FFOs as a function of their mass within our\nlocal region of the Galaxy.

By shadowing and working alongside IDL discipline engineers, participants experience firsthand the science and cost constraints, trade-offs, and teamwork that are required for optimal instrument design. Each PSWS is collaboratively designed with representatives from SSED, IDL, and the instrument PI, to ensure value added for all stakeholders.

Since sterile neutrinos\ncan influence cosmic evolution by modifying the radiation content and\nsuppressing structure formation, GW standard sirens offer promising prospects\nfor constraining sterile neutrino properties within a cosmological framework.\nBuilding on this, we investigate the prospects for detecting sterile neutrinos\nin dynamical dark energy (DE) models using joint observations from 3G GW\ndetectors and a future short gamma-ray burst detector, such as a THESEUS-like\ntelescope. We consider three DE models: the $w$CDM, holographic DE (HDE), and\nChevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) models.

The two translations of the treatise into English that I am familiar with\ndiffer at one point substantially from each other. Unambiguously, the year and\nseason of the comet's appearance was early 372 BC (or -371). From Aristotle's\nconstraint on the comet's setting relative to sunset, I infer that the probable\ndate of perihelion passage was January 20, a date also consistent with the\nvague remark on frosty weather. On the day that Aristotle claims the comet was\nnot seen, its head may have been hidden behind the Sun's disk or in contact\nwith it. The observation that the `comet receded as far as Orion's belt, where\nit dissolved' is being satisfied by the tested orbit if the perihelion was\nreached between January 20 and February 10. Aristotle's third statement, which\ndescribes the tail as a streak 60 degrees in length, suggests a plasma feature\nstretching in space over 0.8 AU. The dust tail was developing more gradually\nand it was all that could be seen from the comet when it was approaching\nOrion's belt in early April. The comet was seen over a period of more than 10\nweeks. The results of this study strengthen the notion that Aristotle's comet\nindeed was the gigantic progenitor of Kreutz sungrazers.",

      "content": "We present the results obtained from the spectral and temporal study of\nthermonuclear bursts from the millisecond X-ray pulsar SRGA J144459.2-604207\ndetected with NICER. The dynamic evolution of the spectral parameters in a\nbroad energy range is also investigated during a simultaneously detected burst\nwith XMM-Newton and NuSTAR. The burst profiles exhibit a strong energy\ndependence, as observed with XMM-Newton, NICER, and NuSTAR. We investigated the\nreflection feature during these bursts using the disk reflection model. As\nobserved during the peak of the NICER bursts, the reflection model can\ncontribute 30 per cent of the overall emission. During the NICER bursts, a\ncorrelation is observed between the flux of the blackbody and the reflection\ncomponents. The measurements of the mass accretion rate indicate that the\nbursts may be powered by a mixed H/He fuel. Moreover, the broadband NICER and\nNuSTAR spectra are also used to probe the reflection signature in the\nburst-free persistent region using the relativistic reflection model. Based on\nthe variability of the count rate during the NuSTAR observation, we also\ninvestigate the evolution of spectral parameters during two different flux\nlevels of the NuSTAR observation. The inner disk radius (Rin) and the angle of\ninclination are found to be nearly 11 Rg and 50 degrees, respectively. The\nmagnetic field strength at the poles of the neutron star is estimated to be 6 x\n10^8 G, assuming that the inner disk is truncated at the magnetospheric\nboundary.",

      "content": "Meteorite fall statistics are frequently used by planetary scientists to approximate the true flux of meteorites on Earth. Meteorite falls are those meteorites that are collected soon after being witnessed to fall, whereas meteorite finds are discovered at a later time. Although there are 30 times as much finds than falls, their raw distribution of types does not accurately reflect what falls to Earth. The reasons for this include the following:\n\nSome meteorite types are easier to find than others.\nSome meteorite types are degraded by weathering more quickly than others.\nSome meteorites, especially iron meteorites, may have been collected by people in the past who recognized them as being unusual and/or useful, thereby removing them from the scientific record.\nMany meteorites fall as showers of many stones, but when they are collected long after the event it may be difficult to tell which ones were part of the same fall.\nMany meteorites are found by people who sell meteorites... valuable, rare types become known to science quickly, while those of low value may never be described.\nThere have been many attempts to correct statistical analyses of meteorite finds for some of these effects, especially to estimate the frequency with which rare meteorite types fall.  For example, there are over 100 known lunar meteorite finds, but none has ever been observed to fall.  However, for abundant types, meteorite fall statistics are generally preferred.\nThese statistics are current through June 9, 2012.",

Cherenkov detectors are\nsensitive to many types of particles that are present in the environment of\nspace, including gamma rays, trapped particles and cosmic particles, and each\nparticle component acts as essentially a background when trying to view another\nspecific particle component. In this research, GRAS/Geant4 simulations were\nperformed to characterise the count rates that a simple Cherenkov detector\ndesign would experience in a low Earth orbit, and we find that Cherenkov count\nrates due to most particle components vary significantly depending on many\ndifferent factors, including the location in the orbit, the date of the orbit,\nwhether or not the detector is within the van Allen belts, and whether or not a\nsolar particle event is occurring. We find that a small Cherenkov detector is\nreadily able to gather detailed data on both trapped particles and spectral\ninformation during Ground-Level Enhancements. We also investigate the use of\ncoincidence as a method to remove count rates due to trapped particles and\ndelta electrons, finding that this method is generally very effective for\nresolving count rates due to GLEs amongst intense trapped particle\nenvironments, but that some Cherenkov count rates due to trapped particles are\nstill observed in the simulated south Atlantic anomaly region.",

Subsequently, a\nlinearized LSQR method is employed to invert station coordinates, receiver\nclock biases, and electromagnetic wave velocities at the bottom of the\nionosphere and troposphere using over six sets of observations. This replaces\nconventional ionospheric/tropospheric pseudorange corrections in single-point\npositioning, establishing a novel spherical coordinate refraction travel time\npositioning method. The classical straight-line pseudorange positioning is\nreformulated into a time-of-flight positioning approach, and the positioning\naccuracy differences between straight-line and spherical coordinate refraction\ntravel time methods are compared.

Although recent studies with fast radio bursts (FRBs)\nhave largely addressed this discrepancy, the precise spatial distribution of\nthese baryons remains uncertain due to the effect of galaxy feedback.\nCosmological hydrodynamical simulations such as Simba have shown that the\npartitioning of baryons between the intergalactic medium (IGM) and haloes is\nsensitive to feedback models, motivating the connection of baryon distribution\nwith feedback physics. With the Simba simulation suite, this study investigates\nhow feedback affects the distribution of matter within large-scale cosmic\nstructures, with implications for FRB foreground modeling. We apply the T-web\nmethod to classify the cosmic web into different structures: knots, filaments,\nsheets, and voids. We then analyze how the different feedback variants of Simba\naffect the distribution of matter within each structure. Our results show that\nin Simba, the fractions of IGM gas in different cosmic web structures vary only\na few percent under different feedback models.

      "content": "Surveys for exoplanets indicate that the occurrence rate of gas giant planets\norbiting late-type stars in orbits with periods shorter than 1000 days is lower\nthan in the case of Sun-like stars. This is in agreement with planet formation\nmodels based on the core or pebble accretion paradigm. The CARMENES exoplanet\nsurvey has been conducting radial-velocity observations of several targets that\nshow long-period trends or modulations that are consistent with the presence of\ngiant planets at large orbital separations. We present an analysis of five such\nsystems that were monitored with the CARMENES spectrograph, as well as with the\nIRD spectrograph. In addition, we used archival data to improve the orbital\nparameters of the planetary systems. We improve the parameters of three\npreviously known planets orbiting the M dwarfs GJ 317, GJ 463, and GJ 3512. We\nalso determine the orbital parameters and minimum mass of the planet GJ 3512 c,\nfor which only lower limits had been given previously. Furthermore, we present\nthe discovery of two new giant planets orbiting the stars GJ 9733 and GJ 508.2,\nalthough for the second one only lower limits to the orbital properties can be\ndetermined. The new planet discoveries add to the short list of known giant\nplanets orbiting M-dwarf stars with subsolar metallicity at long orbital\nperiods above 2000 days. These results reveal that giant planets appear to form\nmore frequently in wide orbits than in close-in orbits around low-mass and\nlower metallicity stars.",

While initially thought to host\nintermediate-mass black holes, ULXs have since been recognized as a diverse\nclass of objects, including ULX pulsars. These pulsars require models\nspecifically tailored to account for their unique accretion physics, distinct\nfrom those used for Galactic black hole binaries. The X-ray spectra of all\nGalactic accreting X-ray pulsars (including sources in the Magellanic Clouds)\nare dominated by a high energy cut-off power-law and some of the sources show a\nsoft excess, some emission lines, cyclotron absorption features, etc. In this\nwork, we undertake a comprehensive analysis of the broadband X-ray spectra of\nfive ULX pulsars using simultaneous XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observations and show\nthat their X-ray spectra can be effectively described by spectral models,\nsimilar to those used for the local accretion-powered X-ray pulsars. A soft\nexcess is detected in all the sources which is also consistent with the local\nX-ray pulsars that have low absorption column density. We have marginal\ndetection or low upper limit on the presence of the iron K-alpha emission line\nfrom these sources, which is a key difference of the ULX pulsars with the local\naccreting X-ray pulsars. We discuss the implication of this on the nature of\nthe binary companion and the accretion mechanism in the ULX pulsars.",

One of marsupials' unique features is their reproductive strategy: the young are born in a relatively undeveloped state and then nurtured within a pouch on their mother's abdomen.\nExtant marsupials encompass many species, including kangaroos, koalas, opossums, possums, Tasmanian devils, wombats, wallabies, and bandicoots.\nMarsupials constitute a clade stemming from the last common ancestor of extant Metatheria, which encompasses all mammals more closely related to marsupials than to placentals. The evolutionary split between placentals and marsupials occurred 125–160 million years ago, in the Middle Jurassic–Early Cretaceous period.\nPresently, close to 70% of the 334 extant marsupial species  are concentrated on the Australian continent, including mainland Australia, Tasmania, New Guinea, and nearby islands. The remaining 30% are distributed across the Americas, primarily in South America, with thirteen species in Central America and a single species, the Virginia opossum, inhabiting North America north of Mexico.\nMarsupial sizes range from a few grams in the long-tailed planigale, to several tonnes in the extinct Diprotodon.\nThe word marsupial comes from marsupium, the technical term for the abdominal pouch. It, in turn, is borrowed from the Latin marsupium and ultimately from the ancient Greek μάρσιππος mársippos, meaning \"pouch\".",

Using the\nfirst 19 encounters of PSP measurements, we identify the young solar wind from\ndifferent source regions: coronal hole (CH) interiors, streamers, and low\nMach-number boundary layers (LMBLs), i.e., the peripheral region inside CHs. We\nassess the wavevector anisotropy with the 2D and slab turbulence model for the\nCH wind and the streamer wind, and the nearly incompressible (NI) MHD\nturbulence model for the LMBL wind where Taylor's hypothesis becomes\nquestionable. Unlike the $\\sim80\\%$ 2D contribution typically reported at 1 au,\nour results show that only $26\\%$ of the inertial range energy is associated\nwith 2D fluctuations in the CH wind, and this fraction increases to $45\\%$ in\nthe streamer wind. As a representation of the LMBL wind, similarly, the oblique\nsub-Alfv\\'enic intervals and the near-subsonic intervals are characterized by\nthe dominance of slab fluctuations. All the results suggest that slab\nfluctuations are more abundant in the young solar wind below 0.3 au than at 1\nau. Furthermore, we find a dependence of the variance anisotropy in the\ninertial range on proton plasma beta $\\beta_p$. The variance anisotropy is the\nstrongest in the LMBL wind with the lowest $\\beta_p$, and the weakest in the\nstreamer wind with the highest $\\beta_p$.

The fundamental problem of this description is associated with\nthe polycrystalline nature of the crust: similar to terrestrial materials, the\nelastic moduli, strictly speaking, depend on the shape and orientation of\ncrystallites, but for the crust, they are unknown. As a result, some\nassumptions are generally required to predict the elastic properties or\nconstrain their possible range. In this paper, we follow the commonly believed\nassumption that the crust is (locally) isotropic, which allows us to describe\nelastic properties by two (effective) parameters: bulk and shear moduli. The\nbulk modulus is well determined by the Voigt-Reuss bounds, and we constrain the\nshear modulus by applying, for the first time in astrophysics of compact stars,\nthe variational Hashin-Shtrikman approach, based on the additional assumption\nthat there are no correlations in the orientation of crystallites. We analyse\nthe Hashin-Shtrikman bounds for the one-component crust taking into account the\nelectron screening and the motion of the nuclei, and for two-component static\ncrystals. In particular, we demonstrate that within applied assumptions the\neffective shear modulus should be lower than the Voigt estimate, typically\napplied in the astrophysical literature.",

Magnetometers are among the most widely used scientific instruments in exploratory and observation satellites. These instruments were instrumental in mapping the Van Allen radiation belts around Earth after its discovery by Explorer 1, and have detailed the magnetic fields of the Earth, Moon, Sun, Mars, Venus and other planets and moons. There are ongoing missions using magnetometers, including attempts to define the shape and activity of Saturn's core.\nThe first spacecraft-borne magnetometer was placed on the Sputnik 3 spacecraft in 1958 and the most detailed magnetic observations of the Earth have been performed by the Magsat and Ørsted satellites. Magnetometers were taken to the Moon during the later Apollo missions. Many instruments have been used to measure the strength and direction of magnetic field lines around Earth and the Solar System.\nSpacecraft magnetometers basically fall into three categories: fluxgate, search-coil and ionized gas magnetometers. The most accurate magnetometer complexes on spacecraft contain two separate instruments, with a helium ionized gas magnetometer used to calibrate the fluxgate instrument for more accurate readings. Many later magnetometers contain small ring-coils oriented at 90° in two dimensions relative to each other forming a triaxial framework for indicating direction of magnetic field.",

Players could construct network systems to distribute resources to other players and construct new ship types to deploy into battle. The plot involves an intergalactic organization, the United Galaxy Space Force, discovering an unknown extraterrestrial species that plans to wipe out all of mankind. It was made for the Namco System N2 arcade board.\nDevelopment of the game was done by internal development group \"Project Starline\", led by Toru Takahashi. Inspired by the Age of Empires series, the team wanted to create a game that would help set a standard for Japanese online games, which were deemed inferior in quality to those overseas. The game was meant to be part of Namco's fictional \"United Galaxy Space Force\" saga and used ships and settings from other Namco video games, including Galaxian, Galaga, Xevious and Starblade. Beta testing for the game was exclusive to Namco-operated café chains in Japan. New Space Order was shown off at the 2007 Amusement Operators Union (AOU) tradeshow, which was followed by a tie-in anime series, New Space Order: Link of Life. Updates for the game would continue to decrease in the years following, and development was officially ceased in 2009 with little to no explanation.",

Here, we\ndevelop a novel modeling approach to explore the rates of learning about\nequilibrium climate sensitivity and the transient climate response (TCR) and\nidentify the physical drivers underpinning these learning rates. Our approach\nhas the advantage over past work by accounting for the full spectrum of\nparameter uncertainties and covariances, while also taking into account\nserially correlated internal climate variability. Moreover, we provide a\nphysical explanation of how quickly we may hope to learn about climate\nsensitivity. We find that, although we are able to constrain future TCR\nregardless of the true underlying value, constraining ECS is more difficult,\nwith low values of ECS being more easily ascertained than high values. This\nasymmetry can be explained by most of the warming this century being\nattributable to the fast climate mode, which is more useful for constraining\nTCR than it is for ECS.

Here, we\npinpoint an alternative mechanism that can introduce asymmetries in transit\nlight curves, potentially affecting the accurate determination of\nmorning-evening differences. Small-scale magnetic field concentrations on the\nsurfaces of the host star affect the visibility of stellar limb regions, making\nthem brighter relative to the non-magnetic case. A difference in magnetization\nbetween the star's western and eastern limbs can thus create an asymmetry in\nlimb brightness and, consequently, an asymmetry between transit ingress and\negress. We model the limb darkening and stellar limb asymmetry in solar-like\nstars using the 3D radiative MHD code MURaM to simulate magnetized stellar\natmospheres and the MPS-ATLAS code to synthesize spectra using ray-by-ray\napproach. Our results show that ingress-egress depth differences can reach up\nto 600 ppm for a 10000 ppm transit at 600 nm, depending on the magnetization of\nthe stellar limbs--significantly interfering with planetary signals.\nObservations of the Sun show that such concentrations are often not accompanied\nby spots and do not manifest in photometric variability, indicating that even\nphotometrically quiet stars can produce such asymmetries.

It embarked on its final mission, STS-133, on February 24, 2011, and touched down for the last time at Kennedy Space Center on March 9, having spent a cumulative total of nearly a full year in space. Discovery performed both research and International Space Station (ISS) assembly missions, and also carried the Hubble Space Telescope into orbit among other satellites. \nDiscovery was the first operational shuttle to be retired, followed by Endeavour and then Atlantis.

      "content": "Marine shallow cumulus clouds have long caused large uncertainty in climate\nprojections. These clouds frequently organize into mesoscale (10-500 km)\nstructures, through two processes that couple the clouds to shallow mesoscale\ncirculations: (i) mesoscale moisture aggregation, and (ii) cold pools, driven\nlocally from rain-evaporation. Since global climate models do not capture these\nmesoscale processes, while the degree of mesoscale organization is observed to\ncorrelate to shortwave cooling, it has been suggested that mesoscale processes\nmodulate the cloud response to global warming. Here, we show that introducing\nmesoscale dynamics can indeed substantially alter top-of-the-atmosphere\nradiative budget, if the balance between the two circulations is upset. By\nhomogenizing rain-evaporation across the horizontal domain, we suppress the\ncold-pool-driven circulations in a large ensemble of large-domain, large-eddy\nsimulations. We find that cold pools reduce mesoscale ascent, thereby arresting\na runaway self-aggregation of moisture into very moist regions. This reduces\nthe net rainfall of the cumulus fields, moistens the boundary layer and thus\nreduces the emission of clear-sky longwave radiation to space, giving an\nensemble-averaged warming of 1.88 W/m2. Our results highlight that the proper\ninterplay between mesoscale processes is critical for capturing radiative\nbudgets-especially in kilometer-scale climate models that only partially\nresolve aggregation and cold pools.",

We find that the\nparticle size distribution of the G ring follows a power law with an exponent\nof 2.8, and dust particles in the size range of $[5, 10]\\,{\\mu}$m are dominant\nwithin the ring. The average number density of particles of the G ring in the\nradial direction is about $10^{-3}$-$10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$. The peak value\nof the edge-on geometric optical depth of the G ring is about\n$3.9\\times10^{-2}$. The maximum apparent edge-on thickness of the G ring with\nthe geometric optical depth larger than $1\\times10^{-8}$ is approximately\n$9,000\\,\\mathrm{km}$. The age of the G ring is estimated to be\n$10^{6}$-$10^{7}\\,\\mathrm{years}$, and the remaining lifetime of the ring is on\nthe order of $10^{4}\\,\\mathrm{years}$.",

      "content": "Phase mixing has long been understood to be a viable mechanism for expediting\nthe dissipation of Alfv\\'en wave energy resulting in the subsequent heating of\nthe solar atmosphere. To fulfil the conditions necessary for phase mixing to\noccur, we consider the cross-field gradient in the Alfv\\'en speed as a free\nparameter in our model. Using a single-fluid description of a partially ionized\nchromospheric plasma, we explore the efficiency of damping of shear Alfv\\'en\nwaves subject to phase mixing when a pulse wave driver is employed. Our results\ndemonstrate a strong dependence of the dissipation length of shear Alfv\\'en\nwaves on both the ionization degree of the plasma and the gradient of the\nAlfv\\'en speed. When assessing the efficiency of phase mixing across various\ninhomogeneities, our findings indicate that waves originating from a pulse\ndriver exhibit initially identical heating rates as those generated by a\ncontinuous wave driver. One key difference observed was that Alfv\\'en pulses\npossess a lower overall decay rate due to a change in damping profile from\nexponential to algebraic. This discrepancy arises from the absence of a\nconsistent injection of energy into the base of the domain, that preserves\nlongitudinal gradients of the magnetic field perturbations more effectively.\nThese findings demonstrate the importance of understanding the relations\nbetween the wave driver, damping mechanisms, and propagation dynamics in\nresolving the atmospheric heating problem.",

      "content": "The precise insertion of CubeSats into designated orbits is a complex task,\nprimarily due to the limited propulsion capabilities and constrained fuel\nreserves onboard, which severely restrict the scope for large orbital\ncorrections. This limitation necessitates the development of more efficient\nmaneuvering techniques to ensure mission success. In this paper, we propose a\nmaneuvering sequence that exploits the natural J2 perturbation caused by the\nEarth's oblateness. By utilizing the secular effects of this perturbation, it\nis possible to passively influence key orbital parameters such as the argument\nof perigee and the right ascension of the ascending node, thereby reducing the\nneed for extensive propulsion-based corrections. The approach is designed to\noptimize the CubeSat's orbital insertion and minimize the total fuel required\nfor trajectory adjustments, making it particularly suitable for\nfuel-constrained missions. The proposed methodology is validated through\ncomprehensive numerical simulations that examine different initial orbital\nconditions and perturbation environments. Case studies are presented to\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the J2-augmented strategy in achieving\naccurate orbital insertion, showing a major reduction in fuel consumption\ncompared to traditional methods.

      "content": "The fluid behavior of the solar wind is affected by the heat flux carried by\nthe suprathermal electron populations, especially the electron strahl (or beam)\nthat propagates along the magnetic field. In turn, the electron strahl cannot\nbe stable, and in the absence of collisions, its properties are regulated\nmainly by self-generated instabilities. This paper approaches the description\nof these heat-flux instabilities in a novel manner using regularized Kappa\ndistributions (RKDs) to characterize the electron strahl. RKDs conform to the\nvelocity distributions with suprathermal tails observed in situ, and at the\nsame time allow for consistent macromodeling, based on their singularity-free\nmoments. In contrast, the complexity of RKD models makes the analytical kinetic\nformalism complicated and still inaccessible, and therefore, here heat-flux\ninstabilities are resolved using the advanced solver ALPS. Two primary types of\ninstabilities emerge depending on plasma conditions: the whistler and firehose\nheat-flux instabilities. The solver is successfully tested for the first time\nfor such instabilities by comparison with previous results for standard\ndistributions, such as Maxwellian and Kappa. Moreover, the new RKD results show\nthat idealized Maxwellian models can overrate or underestimate the effects of\nthese instabilities, and also show differences from those obtained for the\nstandard Kappa, which, for instance, underestimate the firehose heat-flux\ngrowth rates.",

      "content": "An evaporative cooler (also known as evaporative air conditioner, swamp cooler, swamp box, desert cooler and wet air cooler) is a device that cools air through the evaporation of water. Evaporative cooling differs from other air conditioning systems, which use vapor-compression or absorption refrigeration cycles. Evaporative cooling exploits the fact that water will absorb a relatively large amount of heat in order to evaporate (that is, it has a large enthalpy of vaporization). The temperature of dry air can be dropped significantly through the phase transition of liquid water to water vapor (evaporation). This can cool air using much less energy than refrigeration. In extremely dry climates, evaporative cooling of air has the added benefit of conditioning the air with more moisture for the comfort of building occupants.\nThe cooling potential for evaporative cooling is dependent on the wet-bulb depression, the difference between dry-bulb temperature and wet-bulb temperature (see relative humidity). In arid climates, evaporative cooling can reduce energy consumption and total equipment for conditioning as an alternative to compressor-based cooling. In climates not considered arid, indirect evaporative cooling can still take advantage of the evaporative cooling process without increasing humidity. Passive evaporative cooling strategies can offer the same benefits as mechanical evaporative cooling systems without the complexity of equipment and ductwork.",

In engineering terms, the \"fit\" is the clearance between two mating parts, and the size of this clearance determines whether the parts can, at one end of the spectrum, move or rotate independently from each other or, at the other end, are temporarily or permanently joined. Engineering fits are generally described as a \"shaft and hole\" pairing, but are not necessarily limited to just round components. ISO is the internationally accepted standard for defining engineering fits, but ANSI is often still used in North America.\nISO and ANSI both group fits into three categories: clearance, location or transition, and interference. Within each category are several codes to define the size limits of the hole or shaft – the combination of which determines the type of fit. A fit is usually selected at the design stage according to whether the mating parts need to be accurately located, free to slide or rotate, separated easily, or resist separation. Cost is also a major factor in selecting a fit, as more accurate fits will be more expensive to produce, and tighter fits will be more expensive to assemble.\nMethods of producing work to the required tolerances to achieve a desired fit range from casting, forging and drilling for the widest tolerances through broaching, reaming, milling and turning to lapping and honing at the tightest tolerances.",

However,\nthere is no consensus on which process is the reason for the fast reconnection.\nIn this paper, we discuss the formation of secondary plasmoids in \\rewrite{2D\nantiparallel collisionless reconnection} using 2.5-dimensional particle-in-cell\nsimulations and discuss whether plasmoid-mediated reconnection occur in\ncollisionless systems by comparing with plasmoid instability in resistive MHD\nsimulations. We find that in collisionless systems secondary plasmoids can\nindeed form. However, the mass ratio has a strong effect on the formation of\nsecondary plasmoids, and it indicates that secondary plasmoids do not emerge\nusing realistic ion-electron mass ratio ($m_i/m_e = 1836$). Furthermore, we\nfind that there is no enhancement of the reconnection rate due to the secondary\nplasmoid in the collisionless system, as discussed in the plasmoid-mediated\nreconnection. Although our simulation $\\mathcal{O}(100\\lambda_i)$ box is not\nlarge enough to discuss astrophysical phenomena such as solar flares, it can\nreflect a relatively small plasma system such as the Earth's magnetotail.",

The third\ninterstellar object, comet 3I/ATLAS, was first discovered on UT 2025 July 1.\nSerendipitously, the Rubin Observatory collected imaging in the area of the sky\ninhabited by the object during regular commissioning activities. We\nsuccessfully recovered object detections from Rubin visits spanning UT 2025\nJune 21 (10 days before discovery) to UT 2025 July 7. Facilitated by Rubin's\nhigh resolution and large aperture, we report on the detection of cometary\nactivity as early as June 21st, and observe it throughout. We measure the\nlocation and magnitude of the object on 37 Rubin images in r, i, and z bands,\nwith typical precision of about 20 mas (100 mas, systematic) and about 10 mmag,\nrespectively. We use these to derive improved orbit solutions, and to show\nthere is no detectable photometric variability on hourly timescales. We derive\na V-band absolute magnitude of H_V = (13.7 +/- 0.2) mag, and an equivalent\neffective nucleus radius of around (5.6 +/- 0.7) km. These data represent the\nearliest observations of this object by a large (8-meter class) telescope\nreported to date, and illustrate the type of measurements (and discoveries)\nRubin's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will begin to provide once\noperational later this year.",

      "content": "In this paper, I emphasize those features of the extended phase space\napproach to quantization of gravity that distinguish it among other approaches.\nFirst of all, it is the conjecture about non-trivial topology of the Universe\nwhich was supported by Wheeler, Hawking and other founders of quantum gravity.\nHowever, this conjecture appears to be in contradiction with the assumption\nabout asymptotic states that is used in the path integral quantization of gauge\ntheories. The presence of asymptotic states ensures gauge invariance of the\ntheory, but, in the case of gravity, the states exist only in asymptotically\nflat spacetimes, that limits possible topologies. Then we have two ways. The\nfirst way is to consider only asymptotically flat spacetimes. In fact, it\nreduces quantum gravity to quantum field theory on a given background. The\nsecond way is to reject the assumption about asymptotic states. In the case of\nnon-trivial topology, one cannot cover the whole spacetime with the only\ncoordinate system. One has to introduce various reference frames fixed by\ndifferent gauge conditions in different spacetime regions. The Hamiltonian\ndescribing a gravitating system will depend on gauge conditions. It leads to\nthe conclusion that unitary evolution may be broken down. This conclusion\ncannot be obtained in approaches based on the Wheeler - DeWitt equation or\nmaking use of the assumption about asymptotic states. The assessment of this\nconclusion is given.",

It was the first time that the first stage of an orbital rocket made a successful return and vertical landing.\nThe successful landing of the first stage at Landing Zone 1, near the launch site, was the result of a five-year technology development program to develop a reusable launch system and came on a flight test that followed the primary launch mission. Following separation of the second stage, SpaceX conducted the eighth of its controlled booster descent tests of the spent first stage, the first in which the descent target location was on land, and also the first ever successful landing.\nPrior to this flight, SpaceX's two previous attempts at a vertical landing and booster recovery ended in failure to recover the rocket. The success of flight 20 marked a significant milestone en route to the company's goal of creating a reusable rocket system that would significantly reduce the cost of launching payloads into orbit.\nFalcon 9 flight 20 was the first launch of the substantially upgraded Falcon 9 Full Thrust version of the Falcon 9 launch vehicle. It carried 11 Orbcomm-OG2 satellites to Earth orbit. The launch was also notable as it was the first SpaceX launch following the catastrophic failure of a Falcon 9 v1.1 launch vehicle's second stage on Falcon 9 Flight 19 in June 2015.",

The mission hopes to resolve the question of whether Mars once harbored life.\nAlthough the proposal is still in the design stage, the Perseverance rover is currently gathering samples on Mars and the components of the sample retrieval lander are in the testing phase on Earth.\nAfter a project review critical of its cost and complexity, NASA announced that the project was \"paused\" as of November 13, 2023. On November 22, NASA was reported to have cut back on the Mars sample-return mission due to a possible shortage of funds. In April 2024, in a NASA update via teleconference, the NASA Administrator emphasized continuing the commitment to retrieving the samples. However, the $11 billion cost was deemed infeasible.

If this is a genuine signal, it could be\nexplained by theories of Chern--Simons-type coupled to electromagnetism, which\ncould lead to a harmonic scale-dependent birefringence signal, if the\nhypothesis of an ultra-light (pseudo) scalar field does not hold.

Both methods yield results consistent with a\nnon-vanishing constant birefringence angle.

      "content": "Low-resolution infrared spectroscopy from JWST confirms the presence of SiC\nand likely metallic iron dust around asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars in the\nSextans A dwarf galaxy, which has a metallicity ~1%-7% Z_sun. While metal-poor\ncarbon-rich AGB stars are known to produce copious amounts of amorphous carbon\ndust owing to the dredge up of newly synthesized carbon, this is the first time\nthat Si- and Fe-bearing dust has been detected at this extreme metallicity. Of\nthe six AGB stars observed, one is an intermediate-mass (~1.2-4 M_sun) carbon\nstar showing SiC dust, and another is an oxygen-rich M-type star with mass ~4-5\nM_sun that is likely undergoing hot bottom burning. The infrared excess of the\nM-type star is strong, but featureless. We tested multiple dust species, and\nfind that it is best fit with metallic iron dust. Assuming its dust-production\nrate stays constant over the final 2-3x10^4 yr of its evolution, this star will\nproduce ~0.9-3.7 times the iron dust mass predicted by models, with the range\ndepending on the adopted stellar mass. The implications for dust production in\nhigh-redshift galaxies are potentially significant, especially regarding the\nassumed dust species used in dust evolution models and the timescale of AGB\ndust formation. Stars on the upper end of the AGB mass range can begin\nproducing dust as early as 30-50 Myr after they form, and they may therefore\nrival dust production by supernovae at high redshift.",

Using $N$-body simulations, we find that the planet could be\ndynamically stable at a mutual angle inclination up to $\\sim75^\\circ$. The von\nZeipel-Lidov-Kozai (vZLK) mechanism becomes active when the mutual inclination\nis greater than 39.2$^\\circ$. High-inclination orbits exhibit coupled\noscillations in eccentricity and inclination, along with apsidal precession.\nSynthetic radial velocity (RV) modeling shows that these secular variations\nproduce measurable signatures across a broad range of timescales, from full\nvZLK cycles to observationally accessible decades. For instance, a high mutual\ninclination at 75$^\\circ$ can induce RV drifts exceeding 5 m s$^{-1}$ per\nplanetary orbit ($\\sim 1.9 \\,\\text{m s}^{-1}\\, \\text{yr}^{-1}$) in circular\nbinary configurations.

The\nLOVEX-specific payload consists of an X-band cryogenic receiver, a hydrogen\nmaser frequency standard, and VLBI data formatting and acquisition electronics.\nSeveral components of the QueQiao-2 nominal onboard instrumentation, such as\nthe 4.2-meter antenna, the data storage device, and the downlink communication\nsystem, contribute to the overall spaceborne VLBI instrumentation. This allows\nus to form a space radio telescope capable of co-observing with Earth-based\nradio telescopes in VLBI mode. In this space VLBI system, the length of the\nbaseline extends up to approximately 380,000 km.

      "content": "Ocean wind waves are a fundamental manifestation of complex dynamics in\ngeophysical fluid systems, characterized by a rich interplay between dispersion\nand nonlinearity. While linear wave theory provides a first-order description\nof wave motion, real-world oceanic environments are governed by nonlinear\ninteractions that are responsible for a transfer of energy between waves of\ndifferent lengths. The pioneering research by O. Phillips, K. Hasselmann, and\nV. Zakharov in the 1960s introduced the concept that four-wave resonant\ninteractions serve as the primary mechanism for energy transfers among wave\ncomponents in oceanic surface wave fields. Although the presence and efficiency\nof these resonant interactions have been demonstrated in controlled determinist\nwave tank experiments, their direct identification in the real ocean, where a\nlarge number of random waves interact, has remained elusive. Here, using a\nstereoscopic system that enables the measurement of surface elevation in both\nspace and time, we provide experimental evidence of resonant interactions in\nocean wind waves. Our data not only reproduce the well-known figure-eight\npattern predicted by Phillips, but also reveal a continuum of different\nresonant configurations that closely match the theoretical predictions. These\nfindings support the validity of third-generation ocean wave models,\nstrengthening their ability to accurately capture wave dynamics in the ocean",

Fish and shellfish concentrate mercury in their bodies, often in the form of methylmercury, a highly toxic organomercury compound. This element is known to bioaccumulate in humans, so bioaccumulation in seafood carries over into human populations, where it can result in mercury poisoning. Mercury is dangerous to both natural ecosystems and humans because it is a metal known to be highly toxic, especially due to its neurotoxic ability to damage the central nervous system.\nIn human-controlled ecosystems of fish, usually done for market production of wanted seafood species, mercury clearly rises through the food chain via fish consuming small plankton, as well as through non-food sources such as underwater sediment.\nFish products have been shown to contain varying amounts of heavy metals, particularly mercury and fat-soluble pollutants from water pollution. Species of fish that are long-lived and high on the food chain, such as marlin, tuna, shark, swordfish, king mackerel and tilefish contain higher concentrations of mercury than others. Cetaceans (whales and dolphins) also bioaccumulate mercury and other pollutants, so populations that eat whale meat, such as the Japanese, Icelanders, Norwegians and the Faroese, are also vulnerable to mercury ingestion.",

Blending\nintroduces a challenge to weak lensing cosmology probes, as such blends are\nsubject to shear signals from multiple redshifts. This effect can be described\nby joining shear bias and redshift characterisation in the effective redshift\ndistribution, $n_{\\gamma}(z)$, which includes the response of apparent shapes\nof detected objects to shear of galaxies at redshift $z$. In this work, we\npropose a novel method to correct $n_{\\gamma}(z)$ for redshift-mixed blending\nby emulating the shear response to neighbouring galaxies. Specifically, we\ndesign a ``half-sky-shearing'' simulation with HSC-Wide-like specifications, in\nwhich we extract the response of a detected object's measured ellipticity to\nshear of neighbouring galaxies among numerous galaxy pairs. We demonstrate the\nfeasibility of accurately emulating these pairwise responses and validate the\nrobustness of our approach under varying observing conditions and galaxy\npopulation uncertainties. We find that the effective redshift of sources at the\nhigh-redshift tail of the distribution is about 0.05 lower than expected when\nnot modelling the effect.

      "content": "The application of convolutional autoencoder deep learning to imaging data\nfor planetary science and astrobiological use is briefly reviewed and explored\nwith a focus on the need to understand algorithmic rationale, process, and\nresults when machine learning is utilized. Successful autoencoders train to\nbuild a model that captures the features of data in a dimensionally reduced\nform (the latent representation) that can then be used to recreate the original\ninput. One application is the reconstruction of incomplete or noisy data. Here\na baseline, lightweight convolutional autoencoder is used to examine the\nutility for planetary image reconstruction or inpainting in situations where\nthere is destructive random noise (i.e., either luminance noise with zero\nreturned data in some image pixels, or color noise with random additive levels\nacross pixel channels). It is shown that, in certain use cases, multi-color\nimage reconstruction can be usefully applied even with extensive random\ndestructive noise with 90% areal coverage and higher. This capability is\ndiscussed in the context of intentional masking to reduce data bandwidth, or\nsituations with low-illumination levels and other factors that obscure image\ndata (e.g., sensor degradation or atmospheric conditions). It is further\nsuggested that for some scientific use cases the model latent space and\nrepresentations have more utility than large raw imaging datasets.",

It is located about 1,800 light-years (550 pc) from Earth in the constellation of Cygnus.\nKepler-452b orbits its star at a distance of 1.04 AU (156 million km; 97 million mi) from its host star (nearly the same distance as Earth from the Sun), with an orbital period of roughly 385 days, has a mass at least five times that of Earth, and has a radius of around 1.6 times that of Earth, or around 60% larger than earth in size. It is the first potentially rocky super-Earth planet discovered orbiting within the habitable zone of a very Sun-like star. However, it is unknown if it is entirely habitable, as it is receiving slightly more energy from its star than Earth and could be subjected to a runaway greenhouse effect.\nThe Kepler space telescope identified the exoplanet, and its discovery was announced by NASA on 23 July 2015. The planet is about 1,800 light-years (550 pc) away from the Solar System. At the speed of the New Horizons spacecraft, at about 59,000 km/h (16,000 m/s; 37,000 mph), it would take approximately 30 million years to get there.",

While they often showed relative sizes, these models were usually not built to scale. The enormous ratio of interplanetary distances to planetary diameters makes constructing a scale model of the Solar System a challenging task. As one example of the difficulty, the distance between the Earth and the Sun is almost 12,000 times the diameter of the Earth.\nIf the smaller planets are to be easily visible to the naked eye, large outdoor spaces are generally necessary, as is some means for highlighting objects that might otherwise not be noticed from a distance.  The Boston Museum of Science had placed bronze models of the planets in major public buildings, all on similar stands with interpretive labels. For example, the model of Jupiter was located in the cavernous South Station waiting area. The properly-scaled, basket-ball-sized model is 1.3 miles (2.14 km) from the model Sun which is located at the museum, graphically illustrating the immense empty space in the Solar System. \nThe objects in such large models do not move. Traditional orreries often did move, and some used clockworks to display the relative speeds of objects accurately. These can be thought of as being correctly scaled in time, instead of distance.",

Physics intersects with many interdisciplinary areas of research, such as biophysics and quantum chemistry, and the boundaries of physics are not rigidly defined. New ideas in physics often explain the fundamental mechanisms studied by other sciences and suggest new avenues of research in these and other academic disciplines such as mathematics and philosophy.\nAdvances in physics often enable new technologies. For example, advances in the understanding of electromagnetism, solid-state physics, and nuclear physics led directly to the development of technologies that have transformed modern society, such as television, computers, domestic appliances, and nuclear weapons; advances in thermodynamics led to the development of industrialization; and advances in mechanics inspired the development of calculus.",

Its intricate deployment was successfully completed on January 4, 2022, ten days after launch, when it was more than 0.8 million kilometers (500,000 mi) away from Earth.\nThe JWST sunshield is about 21 m × 14 m (69 ft × 46 ft), roughly the size of a tennis court, and is too big to fit in any existing rocket.  Therefore, it was folded up to fit within the fairing of the launch rocket and was deployed post-launch, unfolding five layers of metal-coated plastic. The first layer is the largest, and each consecutive layer decreases in size.  Each layer is made of a thin (50 microns for the first layer, 25 microns for the others) Kapton membrane coated with aluminum for reflectivity.  The outermost Sun-facing layers have a doped-silicon coating which gives it a purple color, toughens the shield, and helps it reflect heat. The thickness of the aluminum coating is approximately 100 nanometers, and the silicon coating is even thinner at approximately 50 nanometers. The sunshield segment includes the layers and its deployment mechanisms, which also includes the trim flap.",

A PlayStation port, developed by Runecraft, was released in 2000, under the name Evo's Space Adventures. Players control Evo, a robot reduced to a crawling microchip after a ship crash, and are tasked with taking control of animals to solve puzzles and defeat enemies.\nDevelopment began in September 1995 as part of a publishing deal with BMG Interactive. When this deal fell through, the development team turned their focus to the Nintendo 64, which allowed for a more advanced environment and model processing. The hardware shaped the game's humour and style, with a soft focus look leading to a style akin to Plasticine models. The distinct British humour was also used to distinguish it from other games, and the music was created to resemble B movies.\nUpon release, Space Station Silicon Valley was acclaimed by many reviewers, with praise particularly directed at the intuitive mechanics, innovative level design, and comical concepts. It won numerous awards, including Game of the Month and Most Innovative Game from IGN. Despite this, the game performed poorly commercially, and was unable to secure enough sales to warrant a sequel.",

This periodic variation is generally\nconsidered to originate from the magnetic reconnection itself rather than from\nexternal driving processes. We conduct 2.5-dimensional radiative\nmagnetohydrodynamic simulations to investigate the emergence of a magnetic flux\ntube from the convection zone into the lower corona, where the emerging\nmagnetic fields reconnect with background ones. During the reconnection process\nwithin 5771 s, the current sheet's orientation has been reversed 41 times,\ncorresponding to 40 oscillation periods. Notably, the longest period is 30\nminutes, which is consistent with the previous observational results. We find\nthat the main factor leading to the reversal of the current sheet's orientation\nis the quasi-periodic external force provided by the emergence of plasma and\nmagnetic fields from the convection zone. We also find the shifting of the\nupward outflows from the reconnection region along the horizontal direction due\nto the alternating changes of the reconnection inflow and outflow regions. In\naddition to the quasi-periodic change of the current sheet orientation, the\nreconnection rate at the main X-point also oscillates with a period between\n100-400 s, which corresponds to the period of p-mode oscillations.",

The corners represent common conjugate variables while the sides represent thermodynamic potentials.

Another mnemonic used here is \"Valid Facts and Theoretical Understanding Generate Solutions to Hard Problems\", which gives the letter in the normal left-to-right writing direction. Both times A has to be identified with F, another common symbol for Helmholtz free energy. To prevent the need for this switch the following mnemonic is also widely used:\"Good Physicists Have Studied Under Very Ambitious Teachers\"; another one is Good Physicists Have SUVAT, in reference to the equations of motion.

In this work, we extend the analysis to the less-explored low-mass\nregime by investigating star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds using data from\nthe VISCACHA survey. We employed a widely used method to quantify the MSTO\nwidth in terms of age spread. Additionally, to validate our approach, we used a\ncluster also observed with HST. Our analysis confirms that the eMSTO phenomenon\nis also present in low-mass clusters, following the known age/mass-MSTO width\nrelations. In particular, the less massive cluster in our sample does not show\nan eMSTO, supporting the proposed link between the eMSTO and the escape\nvelocity of the cluster, providing a new lower limit to the age spread of\n$88\\pm40$ Myr for the presence of the eMSTO.

The results show good agreement with observational\ndata, placing the predictions within the $1 \\sigma$ region of the ACT $r-n_s$\nconstraint plot. Furthermore, incorporating the running of the scalar spectral\nindex reinforces the models consistency with observational bounds. We also\nexplore the parameter space of the EGB couplings and identify the range of free\nparameters for which the results of $n_s$ and $r$ values remain within the $1\n\\sigma$ region of the ACT constraints. Finally, we also investigate the\nreheating phase, demonstrating that the model not only agrees with ACT data but\nalso satisfies the lower bound on the reheating temperature, thereby ensuring a\nconsistent and viable cosmological scenario.",

      "content": "Spaceflight began in the 20th century following theoretical and practical breakthroughs by Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, Robert H. Goddard, and Hermann Oberth, each of whom published works proposing rockets as the means for spaceflight. The first successful large-scale rocket programs were initiated in Nazi Germany by Wernher von Braun. The Soviet Union took the lead in the post-war Space Race, launching the first satellite, the first animal, the first human and the first woman into orbit. The United States landed the first men on the Moon in 1969. Through the late 20th century, France, the United Kingdom, Japan, and China were also working on projects to reach space.\nFollowing the end of the Space Race, spaceflight has been characterized by greater international cooperation, cheaper access to low Earth orbit and an expansion of commercial ventures. Interplanetary probes have visited all of the planets in the Solar System, and humans have remained in orbit for long periods aboard space stations such as Mir and the ISS. Most recently, China has emerged as the third nation with the capability to launch independent crewed missions, while operators in the commercial sector have developed reusable booster systems and craft launched from airborne platforms. In 2020, SpaceX became the first commercial operator to successfully launch a crewed mission to the International Space Station with Crew Dragon Demo-2.",

Fast pulsations (69 ms) in this source\nwere discovered in 1980 during a bright outburst in which it reached a\nluminosity of ~8E38 erg/s, but were never reobserved since then.

Specifically, it is known that at the foam\nlevel, topologically non-trivial solutions such as instantons appear. In the\nparticular case of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, we obtain an effective\ndynamical dark energy term proportional to the instanton density, and the\nlatter can be easily calculated through standard techniques. Hence, we can\nimmediately extract the differential equation that determines the evolution of\nthe topologically induced effective dark energy density. Significantly, this\nTDE scenario allows for changing sign of dark energy during the cosmic\nevolution and also exhibits Dark Energy interaction with Dark Matter. We\nconfront the TDE scenario, in both flat and non-flat cases, with\nPantheon+/SH0ES Supernovae Type Ia (SNIa), Baryonic Accoustic Oscillations\n(BAO), and Cosmic Chronometers (CC) datasets.

But only one has been visible: PSR\nJ0737$-$3039; and its component pulsar B has now rotated out of sight due to\nthe general-relativistic effect of geodetic precession. We know, though, that\nthese precession cycles can also pivot pulsars into sight, and that this\nprecession occurs at similar strength in PSR J1906+0746. That source is a\nyoung, unrecycled radio pulsar, orbiting a compact object with mass $\\sim $1.32\nM$_{\\odot}$. This work presents a renewed campaign to detect radio pulsations\nfrom this companion, two decades after the previous search. Two key reasons\ndriving this reattempt are the possibility that the companion radio beam has\nsince precessed into our line of sight, and the improved sensitivity now\noffered by the FAST radio telescope. In 28 deep observations, we did not detect\na credible companion pulsar signal. After comparing the possible scenarios, we\nconclude the companion is still most likely a pulsar that is not pointing at\nus. We next present estimates for the sky covered by such systems throughout\ntheir precession cycle. We find that for most system geometries, the all-time\nbeaming fraction is unity, i.e., observers in any direction can see the system\nat some point.

Currently, the role of\ndynamical changes during SSW events on radiative cooling in the MLT region is\nnot well understood. An investigation of the SSW-induced changes in CO$_2$\nradiative cooling in the MLT region is presented by examining the changes in\nthe dynamics and transport of key species, such as CO$_2$ and atomic oxygen\n(O). A composite analysis has been performed to understand these changes during\nthe major SSW events that occurred between 2005 and 2020. The variation of\ntrace species is found to be associated with the change in vertical residual\ncirculation. The results also show that CO$_2$ radiative cooling decreases\nduring the mesospheric cooling that occurs during the stratospheric warming\nover the polar region. During the recovery stage of the SSW event, the CO$_2$\nradiative cooling enhances in the mesosphere. These variations in CO$_2$\nradiative cooling are mainly caused by temperature perturbations and oxygen\ntransport in the MLT region.

When heated by the Sun, the gases sublime and produce an atmosphere surrounding the nucleus known as the coma. The force exerted on the coma by the Sun's radiation pressure and solar wind cause an enormous tail to form, which points away from the Sun.  A typical comet nucleus has an albedo of 0.04. This is blacker than coal, and may be caused by a covering of dust.\nResults from the Rosetta and Philae spacecraft show that the nucleus of 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko has no magnetic field, which suggests that magnetism may not have played a role in the early formation of planetesimals. Further, the ALICE spectrograph on Rosetta determined that electrons (within 1 km (0.62 mi) above the comet nucleus) produced from photoionization of water molecules by solar radiation, and not photons from the Sun as thought earlier, are responsible for the degradation of water and carbon dioxide molecules released from the comet nucleus into its coma. On 30 July 2015, scientists reported that the Philae spacecraft, that landed on comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko in November 2014, detected at least 16 organic compounds, of which four (including acetamide, acetone, methyl isocyanate and propionaldehyde) were detected for the first time on a comet.",

However, challenges\nsuch as low lensing efficiency, high shape measurement uncertainty, and a\nscarcity of background galaxies have prevented us from characterizing their\nmasses with weak gravitational lensing (WL) beyond the redshift $z\\sim1.75$. In\nthis paper, we report the successful WL detection of JKCS 041 and XLSSC 122 at\n$z=1.80$ and $z=1.98$, respectively, utilizing deep infrared imaging data from\nthe Hubble Space Telescope with careful removal of instrumental effects.

Here we present JWST observations of the WR+WR\ncolliding-wind binary Apep which reveal an intricate series of nested\nconcentric dust shells that are abundant in detailed substructure. The striking\nregularity in these substructures between successive shells suggests an exactly\nrepeating formation mechanism combined with a highly stable outflow that\nmaintains a consistent morphology even after reaching 0.6 pc (assuming a\ndistance of 2.4 kpc) into the interstellar medium. The concentric dust shells\nshow subtle deviations from spherical outflow, which could reflect orbital\nmodulation along the eccentric binary orbit or some mild degree of\nnon-sphericity in the stellar wind. Tracking the evolution of dust across the\nmulti-tiered structure, we measure the dust temperature evolution that can\nbroadly be described with an amorphous carbon composition in radiative thermal\nequilibrium with the central stars. The temperature profile and orbital period\nplace new distance constraints that support Apep being at a greater distance\nthan previously estimated, reducing the line-of-sight and sky-plane wind speed\ndiscrepancy previously thought to characterise the system.",

The geometrical sector becomes a one-dimensional mechanical\nsystem, with the Misner-Sharp mass and lapse as canonically conjugate\nvariables, and a vanishing Hamiltonian for pure gravity. Coupling classical or\nquantum matter fields, or introducing (quantum) corrections to general\nrelativity, then generate a non-vanishing effective Hamiltonian, leading to\nnon-trivial evolutions of the mass and lapse. We illustrate this mechanism\nthrough various examples of classical matter fields and identify Hamiltonians\ndescribing the effective dynamics of gravity coupled to perfect fluids with\nlinear barotropic equation of state. Finally, we derive effective Hamiltonians\nthat reproduce the gravitational semi-classical dynamics coupled to\nrenormalized quantum matter fields and discuss the conditions for which the\nsingularity at $r=0$ is resolved. In particular, we find a singularity-free\nblack-hole-like solution, stabilized by quantum matter, smoothly transitioning\nfrom a bulk with constant negative Ricci scalar to the standard outside\nSchwarzschild metric.

The Next Nine were the first astronaut group to include civilian test pilots: See had flown for General Electric, and Armstrong had flown the X-15 rocket-powered aircraft for NASA.

      "content": "Newborn pulsars resulting from core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) are promising\nsources of high-energy (HE) cosmic rays and neutrinos. In this work, we focus\non HE neutrinos generated by interactions between protons accelerated in\nrelativistic pulsar winds and SN ejecta. Using a binned likelihood analysis, we\nevaluate the detection prospects of these neutrinos with IceCube and explore\ntheir potential for probing the initial spin period ($P$) and magnetic field\nstrength ($B$) of newborn pulsars. Noticing a degeneracy in neutrino signal\nwith $B/P^2$ across a broad parameter space, we find that HE neutrinos from a\ngalactic newborn pulsar ($d=10$ kpc) with $(B/10^{12}~{\\rm G})(P/{\\rm ms})^{-2}\n\\gtrsim 0.003$ can be detected at $\\gtrsim 3\\sigma$ significance. Even in the\nabsence of a nearby pulsar, the diffuse flux from the cosmologic population of\npulsars could be probed by next-generation detectors like IceCube-Gen2 and\nGRAND200k. For galactic pulsars with $(B/10^{12}~{\\rm G})(P/{\\rm ms})^{-2}\n\\gtrsim 0.08$, the combination $B/P^2$ can be measured with an accuracy of\nbetter than 20\\% at the $3\\sigma$ confidence level. Additionally, we show that\nfor pulsars with detectable HE neutrino signals, the emission can be clearly\ndistinguished from neutrinos produced by interactions between SN ejecta and the\ncircumstellar medium, due to their distinct temporal and spectral features.",

In a previous study, we demonstrated that closed turbulent magnetic\narcades trap efficiently GCRs leading to a gamma-ray flux consistent with the\nFermi-HAWC observations (from $\\sim 0.1$ GeV to $\\sim 1$ TeV). Here, we model a\nsynthetic magnetic field with a static, laminar structure of open field lines\nin the chromosphere increasingly braiding near the solar surface, with a scale\nheight of $\\sim 10^{-2} R_\\odot$. The height-dependent increase in magnetic\nfield line braiding is modulated by an exponential scalar function, mimicking\nthe bending of the photo- and chromo-spheric magnetic field revealed by\npolarimetric observations and reproduced by MHD simulations. Employing 3D\ntest-particle numerical simulations, we investigate how distorted magnetic\nfield lines affect the gamma-rays production by injecting GeV-TeV protons into\nboth magnetically laminar and braided regions. We find that with the chosen\nspatial resolution this synthetic magnetic field can account for the $> 10$ GeV\ngamma-ray spectrum observed by Fermi-LAT/HAWC.

We show that these structures play a significant role in regulating\nturbulent transport. We focus on the pedestal, studying\nelectron-temperature-gradient (ETG) mode destabilisation and saturation in the\npresence of radial corrugations on the electron temperature gradient that could\nresult from microtearing turbulence. A linear dispersion relation is derived\nfor a shearless slab case, which indicates that in the presence of a sinusoidal\nbackground corrugation, each ETG mode splits into three distinct eigenvalues,\nwith one being the original, one being more unstable and one being less\nunstable. However, despite the presence of more unstable linear modes,\nnonlinear gyrokinetic simulations of ETG with corrugated background electron\ntemperature show a reduction of fluxes. Our investigation reveals a radial\nvariation of the phase velocity of the modes that is proportional to the\ndiamagnetic drift velocity and the local pressure gradient. The associated\nprofile shearing breaks the turbulent eddies apart, reducing the transport\nlevel. This profile shearing resulting from fine-scale pressure corrugations\ncould be a ubiquitous turbulence saturation mechanism not just in Fusion\nplasmas, but in Astrophysics and other areas.",

      "content": "Tracking the cold molecular gas contents of galaxies is critical to\nunderstand the interplay between star formation and galaxy growth across cosmic\ntime. Observations of the long-wavelength dust continuum, a proxy for the cold\ngas, are widely used in the high-redshift community because of their ease and\nefficiency. These measurements rely on the assumption of a molecular\ngas-to-dust mass ratio, typically taken to be GDR ~ 100 in massive, metal-rich\nsystems. We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA)\nobservations of the 870um dust continuum in a sample of five massive quiescent\ngalaxies at z ~ 1 with existing detections of CO(2-1). We find surprisingly\nweak dust emission, falling a factor of >~0.4-0.8 dex below the typical\ncorrelation between CO and continuum luminosity. We interpret this dust\ndeficiency as evidence for unusually high GDR in these galaxies, which we\ncalculate to range from 300 to at least 1200. Our results and other\nobservations from the literature are generally compatible with predictions from\nthe SIMBA cosmological simulation that dust is preferentially destroyed in\nquiescent galaxies. Ultimately, we conclude that the dust continuum is a highly\nunreliable tracer of the molecular gas in high-redshift quiescent galaxies. As\na consequence we may know much less about the cold gas contents of this\npopulation than previously thought.",

      "content": "The extraction of the sky-averaged 21 cm signal from Cosmic Dawn and the\nEpoch of Reionization faces significant challenges. The bright and anisotropic\nGalactic foreground, which is 4 - 5 orders of magnitude brighter than the 21 cm\nsignal, when convolved with the inevitably chromatic beam, introduces\nadditional spectral structures that can easily mimic the real 21 cm signal. In\nthis paper, we investigate the signal extraction for a lunar-orbit experiment,\nwhere the antenna moves fast in orbit and data from multiple orbits have to be\nused. We propose a physics-motivated and correlated modeling of both the\nforeground and the measurement errors. By dividing the sky into multiple\nregions according to the spectral index distribution and accounting for the\nfull covariance of modeling errors, we jointly fit both the foreground and the\n21 cm signal using simulated data for the Discovering the Sky at the Longest\nwavelength lunar orbit experiment. This method successfully extracts the 21 cm\nsignals of various amplitudes from the simulated data even for a testing\nantenna with a relatively high level of chromaticity. This approach, which is\nrobust against moderate beam chromaticity, significantly relaxes the stringent\ndesign and manufacturing requirements for the antenna, offering a practical\nsolution for future 21 cm global signal experiments either on the ground or in\nspace.",

We use updated data for some well-known pulsars,\nnamely PSR J1738+0333, PSR J1012+5307, and PSR J1713+0747, to extract the\nKeplerian and post-Keplerian parameters that characterize their orbital\ndynamics, using recent high-precision pulsar timing data and a Bayesian\nparameter estimation with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques.

The available Gaia-based\ncatalogs of resolved binaries provide the projected angular separation between\nthe components, while the physical semimajor axis is the parameter of interest.\nThe problem of reconstructing the distribution of orbit sizes is complex and\nill-posed, because the observed apparent separations are defined by a number of\nunderlying physical parameters including semimajor axis, eccentricity, orbit\norientation, and orbital phase. Methods of inverse reconstruction of the\nmarginal distribution of semimajor axes from the available data are proposed\nand implemented with two different strategies, namely, a direct Monte Carlo\nmapping and inverse filtering with impulse updates without regularization.

      "content": "Asteroids is a 1979 multidirectional shooter video game developed and published by Atari, Inc. for arcades. The player controls a single spaceship in an asteroid field which is periodically traversed by flying saucers. The object of the game is to shoot and destroy the asteroids and saucers, while not colliding with either, or being hit by the saucers' counter-fire. The game becomes more difficult as the number of asteroids increases.\nAsteroids was conceived and designed by Lyle Rains and Ed Logg, who decided to use hardware developed by Wendi Allen (then known as Howard Delman) that was previously used for Lunar Lander. Asteroids was based on an unfinished game titled Cosmos; its physics model, control scheme, and gameplay elements were derived from Spacewar!, Computer Space, and Space Invaders and refined through trial and error. The game is rendered on a vector display in a two-dimensional view that wraps around both screen axes.\nAsteroids was one of the first major hits of the golden age of arcade games; the game sold  47,840 upright cabinets and 8,725 cocktail cabinets and proved both popular with players and influential with developers. In the 1980s it was ported to Atari's home systems, and the Atari VCS version sold over three million copies. The game was widely imitated, and it directly influenced Defender, Gravitar, and many other video games.",

These developments mostly took place in the Middle East, Central Asia, Al-Andalus, and North Africa, and later in the Far East and India. It closely parallels the genesis of other Islamic sciences in its assimilation of foreign material and the amalgamation of the disparate elements of that material to create a science with Islamic characteristics. These included Greek, Sassanid, and Indian works in particular, which were translated and built upon.\nIslamic astronomy played a significant role in the revival of ancient astronomy following the loss of knowledge during the early medieval period, notably with the production of Latin translations of Arabic works  during the 12th century.\nA significant number of stars in the sky, such as Aldebaran, Altair and Deneb, and astronomical terms such as alidade, azimuth, and nadir, are still referred to by their Arabic names.  A large corpus of literature from Islamic astronomy remains today, numbering approximately 10,000 manuscripts scattered throughout the world, many of which have not been read or catalogued. Even so, a reasonably accurate picture of Islamic activity in the field of astronomy can be reconstructed.",

The mapping was performed by a conditional variational\nautoencoder (CVAE) with mass correction. Applied for test data, we show that\nthe prediction obtained by the CVAE already gives a reasonable good\napproximation of the steady states obtained by a regular spin-up. However, the\npredictions do not reach the same level of annual periodicity as those obtained\nin the original spin-up data. Thus, we took the predictions as initial values\nfor a spin-up. We could show that the number of necessary iterations,\ncorresponding to model years, to reach a prescribed stopping criterion in the\nspin-up could be significantly reduced compared to the use of the originally\nuniform, constant initial value. The amount of reduction depends on the applied\nstopping criterion, measuring the periodicity of the solution. The savings in\nneeded iterations and, thus, computing time for the spin-up ranges from 50 to\n95\\%, depending on the stopping criterion for the spin-up. We compared these\nresults with the use of the mean of the training data as an initial value. We\nfound that this also accelerates the spin-up, but only by a much lower factor.",

It launches from Cape Canaveral Launch Complex 36, with future missions planned from Vandenberg Space Launch Complex 9.\nDevelopment of New Glenn began prior to 2013 and was officially announced in 2016. The rocket is named in honor of NASA astronaut John Glenn, the first American to orbit Earth. The inaugural vehicle was unveiled on the launch pad in February 2024. Its maiden flight took place on 16 January 2025, carrying a prototype Blue Ring spacecraft, marking the first launch from LC-36 since NROL-23 in 2005. This mission served as the first of several demonstration launches required to be certified for use by the National Security Space Launch program.\nSimilar to Blue Origin's New Shepard suborbital rocket, used for space tourism, the New Glenn's first stage is designed to be reusable and land on a barge called Landing Platform Vessel 1. New Glenn has not yet achieved a booster landing. In 2021, the company launched Project Jarvis, an initiative aimed at making the second stage reusable as well.",

There is some variation in counts of Spacelab missions, in part because there were different types of Spacelab missions with a large range in the amount of Spacelab hardware flown and the nature of each mission. There were at least 22 major Spacelab missions between 1983 and 1998, and Spacelab hardware was used on a number of other missions, with some of the Spacelab pallets being flown as late as 2008.",

Using the hidden integrability of the self-dual\nsector, we can solve the linearised Einstein equations on these self-dual black\nhole backgrounds exactly in terms of simple, explicit quasi-momentum\neigenstates. Using a description of the self-dual Taub-NUT metric and its\ngravitons in terms of twistor theory, we obtain an explicit formula, exact in\nthe background, for the tree-level maximal helicity violating graviton\nscattering amplitude at arbitrary multiplicity, with and without spin. This is\nobtained from the description of the MHV amplitudes in terms of the\nperturbation theory of a chiral sigma model whose target is the twistor space\nof the background. The incorporation of spin effects on these backgrounds is a\nstraightforward application of the Newman-Janis shift.

The cast features James Spader, Angela Bassett, Robert Forster, Lou Diamond Phillips, Peter Facinelli, Robin Tunney, and Wilson Cruz. The film was shot by cinematographer Lloyd Ahern II and scored by composers David C.

We identify four double-lined spectroscopic binaries\n(SB2) featuring slow-rotating companions, further supporting this tidal-locking\nhypothesis. However, the spatial distribution and the cumulative radial\ndistribution indicate a higher concentration of red eMSTO stars in the\ncluster's central region than their bluer counterparts.

By combining one of three upper stages with three different diameters of solids built to any length needed, the SLS provided wide flexibility in launch capability.\nThe SLS was one of two programs being designed at different divisions within the Air Force, with the ultimate aim of providing the launch services for the X-20 Dyna Soar crewed spaceplane. Its competition was an upgraded version of the Titan I with a new upper stage that produced the Titan C concept. In the end, neither SLS or Titan C would be developed, in its place the new Titan III was selected, combining the new missile of the Titan C with the solid boosters of the SLS.\nThe SLS was also needed for the Lunex Project, a proposed human lunar landing in 1967.\nThe replacing Titan III was more formally known as Program 624A (SSLS), Standard Space Launch System, Standardized Space Launch System, Standardized Space Launching System or Standard Space Launching System.",

If a planet is in a highly inclined orbit, it\ninteracts with the disc, and the eccentricity increases due to the Kozai-Lydov\nmechanism.\n  A planet may stop or reverse its migration in the inner disc before entering\nthe cavity. The magnetosphere interacts with the inner disc, changing its\ndensity distribution such that migration slows down or is even reversed. A\ntilted magnetosphere also excites density and bending waves in the disc, which\nmay slow down migration and also increase the inclination and eccentricity of\nthe planet. When a planet reaches the disc-cavity boundary, it is typically\ntrapped at the boundary by asymmetric corotation torque. A planet moves\ntogether with the boundary when the cavity expands. Overall, a magnetized star\nprovides an environment for slow or reverse migration.",

The success of such searches depends on a reliable\nbackground prediction via Monte Carlo simulations. A widely used toolkit to\nconstruct these simulations is Geant4, which offers the user a wide choice of\nhow to model the physics of particle interactions. For example, for\nelectromagnetic interactions, Geant4 provides pre-defined sets of models:\nphysics constructors. As decay products of radioactive contaminants contribute\nto the background mainly via electromagnetic interactions, the physics\nconstructor used in a Geant4 simulation may have an impact on the total energy\ndeposition inside the detector target. To facilitate the selection of physics\nconstructors for simulations of experiments that are using CaWO$_\\mathrm{4}$\nand Ge targets, we quantify their impact on the total energy deposition for\nseveral test cases. These cases consist of radioactive contaminants commonly\nencountered, covering energy depositions via $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, and $\\gamma$\nparticles, as well as two examples for the target thickness: thin and bulky.

Using direct numerical\nsimulations, we calculate the shell-to-shell energy transfer rates\ncorresponding to b-to-b (magnetic to magnetic) and j-to-b (current to magnetic)\nchannels due to the Hall term, and convincingly show that both channels\ncomprise of a combination of local and non-local energy transfers. A local\ninverse transfer is consistently observed at all scales of the b-to-b channel\nwhereas for the j-to-b channel, the transfer due to local interactions shows a\ntransition from a weak inverse to a strong direct cascade across the Hall\nscale. Calculating mediator-specific transfer rates, we also conclude that a\nconsiderable amount of local energy transfer is mediated by the non-local\ntriads, especially at small-scales of j-to-b transfer. Assuming power-laws for\nthe modal fields, we offer heuristic arguments for some of our observed\nresults. The present study captures the intricate dynamics of energy transfer\ndue to the Hall term and hence can be used to develop more insightful\nanalytical models (shell models for example) for Hall magnetohydrodynamic\ncascade and to carefully segregate the local and the non-local heating in the\nspace plasmas.",

Both binary neutron star (BNS)\nand binary low-mass black hole (LMBH) mergers produce nearly identical inspiral\nwaveforms, and electromagnetic follow-up is not always possible. Distinguishing\nbetween these scenarios therefore presents a key challenge. We demonstrate that\nwaveform differences in the late-inspiral to postmerger epochs create\nsignificant mismatches that will be detectable by planned detectors, viz.,\nNEMO, Cosmic Explorer, and Einstein Telescope, while the currently operational\nLIGO A+ will be effective only for nearby sources.

We forecast model-independent 90% exclusion sensitivities for the\nLMBH fraction. Interpreting these LMBHs as dark matter capture-induced\ntransmuted black holes, we convert exclusion sensitivities into projected\nexclusion bounds on heavy non-annihilating dark matter.

Traditional metrics, such as the standard\ndeviation, fail to isolate stochastic fluctuations from deterministic trends in\nsolar irradiance. By considering clear-sky irradiance as a dynamic upper bound\nof measurement, sCV provides a normalized, dimensionless measure of variability\nthat theoretically ranges from 0 to 1. F extends sCV by integrating temporal\ndependencies via maximum autocorrelation, thus linking sCV with F. The proposed\nmethodology is validated using synthetic cyclostationary time series and\nexperimental data from 68 meteorological stations (in Spain). Our comparative\nanalyses demonstrate that sCV and F proficiently encapsulate multi-scale\nfluctuations, while addressing significant limitations inherent in traditional\nmetrics. This comprehensive framework enables a refined quantification of solar\nforecast uncertainty, supporting improved decision-making in flexibility\nprocurement and operational strategies.

To\ndo so, we have created gridded convective mass flux datasets from five global\nstorm-resolving models (GSRMs). We have three principal findings. First, in\nhumid environments, mass flux increases with height from the surface through\nthe depth of the lower free troposphere, forming a ``deep-inflow\". In dry\nenvironments, mass flux decreases with height through the lower free\ntroposphere. Second, mid-tropospheric mass flux increases nonlinearly with\nincreasing lower tropospheric humidity, resembling a widely reported pickup in\ntropical precipitation. Third, increased lower tropospheric humidity is\nassociated with reduced deep convective updraft buoyancy. To interpret these\nfindings, we employ a simple three-equation parcel model with stochastic\nentrainment. The parcel model suggests that the response of convective mass\nflux to lower tropospheric humidity is governed by two mechanisms: (1)\nsurvival, in which a greater share of entraining parcels ascend rather than\ndetrain with greater humidity; and (2) dilution, in which the average\nentrainment rate among surviving parcels increases with environmental humidity.\nTogether, these two mechanisms account for the three mass flux responses to\nhumidity.",

      "content": "This study investigates the nonlinear interactions between electrons and\nelectron-cyclotron resonance (ECR) heating beams in magnetized, low-temperature\nfusion plasmas, focusing on enhancing pre-ionization efficiency. We analyse key\nparameters affecting ECR absorption, including phase angle, temperature\ninhomogeneity, magnetic field gradients, and beam characteristics like width\nand frequency. Using 2D simulations for these low temperature plasmas, we\ndemonstrate electrons gain energy through nonlinear trapping in velocity space\nnear the resonance layer, achieving energy levels up to 1 keV under optimal\nconditions. Notably, narrow beam widths allow electrons to reach higher energy\nlevels more efficiently than broader beams, highlighting the spatial\nlocalization of the nonlinear interactions to regions where the field is strong\nand frequency mismatch is small. Our findings show that in devices with\nlower-frequency ECR systems, such as TCV (82.7 GHz), electrons can gain up to\n800 eV, while higher-frequency devices, like ASDEX-Upgrade (140 GHz) and ITER\n(170 GHz), achieve lower energy gains (480 eV and 420 eV, respectively) under\nsimilar conditions. These insights are directly applicable to improving ECR\nheating strategies, informing design choices in future fusion devices to\noptimize energy transfer during plasma breakdown and startup.",

While multiple dynamical evidence suggests high-eccentricity\nmigration is most likely, conflicts remain when considering hot Jupiters as a\npopulation in the context of warm and cold Jupiters. Here, we turn to\natmospheric signatures as an alternative mean to test the origin theory of hot\nJupiters, focusing on population level trends that arise from post-formation\npollution, motivated by the upcoming Ariel space mission whose goal is to\ndeliver a uniform sample of exoplanet atmospheric constraints. We experiment\nwith post-formation pollution by planetesimal accretion, pebble accretion, and\ndisk-induced migration and find that an observable signature of post-formation\npollution is only possible under pebble accretion in metal-heavy disks. If most\nhot Jupiters arrive at their present orbit by high-eccentricity migration while\nwarm Jupiters emerge largely in situ, we expect the atmospheric water abundance\nof hot Jupiters to be significantly elevated compared to warm Jupiters, at a\nlevel that is easily detectable by Ariel transit survey.

Initially slotted as the flagship Mercury full-size range (above the Monterey), the Marquis would serve as the basis for the later Mercury Grand Marquis.           \nThe first three generations of the Marquis were full-size sedans (alongside the Mercury Colony Park station wagon).  For the fourth generation, the Marquis became the mid-size Mercury sedan, following the 1983 split of the Marquis and Grand Marquis into distinct product lines.  As Ford Motor Company expanded its use of front-wheel drive, the Marquis ended production after the 1986 model year, replaced by the Mercury Sable (the Mercury counterpart of the Ford Taurus).  As the Grand Marquis, the nameplate continued on until the closure of Mercury during the 2011 model year.          \nFor its first three generations, the Mercury Marquis was produced by Ford in Hapeville, Georgia (Atlanta Assembly), Hazelwood, Missouri (St. Louis Assembly), and Pico Rivera, California (Los Angeles Assembly); the fourth generation was produced by Atlanta Assembly and in Chicago, Illinois (Chicago Assembly).",

Its effects may take up to four weeks but can also manifest as early as one to two weeks. It is often used in cases of depression complicated by anxiety or insomnia. The effectiveness of mirtazapine is comparable to other commonly prescribed antidepressants. It is taken by mouth.\nCommon side effects include sleepiness, dizziness, increased appetite, and weight gain. Serious side effects may include mania, low white blood cell count, and increased suicide among children. Withdrawal symptoms may occur with stopping. It is not recommended together with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, although evidence supporting the danger of this combination has been challenged. It is unclear if use during pregnancy is safe. How it works is not clear, but it may involve blocking certain adrenergic and serotonin receptors. Chemically, it is a tetracyclic antidepressant, and is closely related to mianserin. It also has strong antihistaminergic effects.\nMirtazapine came into medical use in the United States in 1996. The patent expired in 2004, and generic versions are available. In 2022, it was the 105th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 6 million prescriptions.",

      "content": "In gravitational theories with boundaries, diffeomorphisms can become\nphysical and acquire a non-vanishing Noether charge. Using the covariant phase\nspace formalism, on shell of the gravitational constraints, the latter\nlocalizes on codimension-$2$ surfaces, the corners. The corner proposal asserts\nthat these charges, and their algebras, must be important ingredients of any\nquantum gravity theory. In this manuscript, we continue the study of quantum\ncorner symmetries and algebras by computing the entanglement entropy and\nquantum informational properties of quantum states abiding to the quantum\nrepresentations of corners in the framework of $2$-dimensional gravity. We do\nso for two classes of states: the vacuum and coherent states, properly defined.\nWe then apply our results to JT gravity, seen as the dimensional reduction of\n$4$d near extremal black holes. There, we demonstrate that the entanglement\nentropy of some coherent quantum gravity states -- states admitting a\nsemiclassical description -- scales like the dilaton, reproducing the\nsemiclassical area law behavior and further solidifying the quantum\ninformational nature of entropy of quantum corners. We then study general\nstates and their gluing procedure, finding a formula for the entanglement\nentropy based entirely on the representation theory of $2$d quantum corners.",

Data driven approaches to this problem\nhave enjoyed much success recently providing forecasts with accuracy comparable\nto physics based numerical prediction models but at significantly reduced\ncomputational expense.

In this work, we demonstrate improved skill of data driven\nweather prediction approaches by incorporating physical constraints,\nspecifically in the context of the DLWP model (Karlbauer et. al. 2024). Near\nhydrostatic balance, between the vertical pressure gradient and gravity, is one\nof the most fundamental and well satisfied constraints on atmospheric motions.\nWe impose this balance through both hard and soft constraints, and demonstrate\nthat the soft constraint improves the RMSE of many forecast fields,\nparticularly at lead times beyond 7-10 days. The positive influence of\nhydrostatic balance is also clearly evident in improving the physicality and\nstrength of a 10-day forecast for hurricane Irma.

This sub-selection systematically affects the\ndark siren inference of the Hubble constant $H_0$, so a completeness relation\nhas to be introduced that accounts for the missing objects. In the literature\nit is standard to assume that the missing galaxies are uniformly distributed\nacross the sky and that the galaxy magnitude distribution is known. In this\nwork we develop a novel method which improves upon these assumptions and\nreconstructs the underlying true galaxy field, respecting the spatial\ncorrelation of galaxies on large scales. In our method the true magnitude\ndistribution of galaxies is inferred alongside the spatial galaxy distribution.\nOur method results in an improved three-dimensional prior in redshift and sky\nposition for the host galaxy of a GW event, which is expected to make the\nresulting $H_0$ posterior more robust.

Among other things, we leverage the\nSherman-Morrison formula to solve cyclic tridiagonal systems from circular line\nsolvers without additional fill-in and we apply reordering to optimize cache\naccess of circular and radial smoothing operations. With the Give approach,\nmemory requirements are further reduced and speedups of four to seven are\nobtained for usual test cases. For the Take approach, speedups of 16 to 18 can\nbe attained.",

      "content": "We present cosmological dark matter (DM)--only zoom-in simulations of a Milky\nWay (MW) analog originating from enhanced linear matter power spectra $P(k)$\nrelative to the standard cold, collisionless DM (CDM) cosmology. We consider a\nGaussian power excess in $P(k)$ followed by a cutoff in select cases; this\nbehavior could arise from early-universe physics that alters the primordial\nmatter power spectrum or DM physics in the radiation-dominated epoch. We find\nthat enhanced initial conditions (ICs) lead to qualitative differences in\nsubstructure relative to CDM. In particular, the subhalo mass function (SHMF)\nresulting from ICs with both an enhancement and cutoff is amplified at high\nmasses and suppressed at low masses, indicating that DM substructure is\nsensitive to features in $P(k)$. Critically, the amplitude and shape of the\nSHMF enhancement depend on the wave number of the $P(k)$ excess and the\npresence or absence of a cutoff on smaller scales. These alterations to the\nSHMF are mainly imprinted at infall rather than during tidal evolution.\nAdditionally, subhalos are found systematically closer to the host center and\ntheir concentrations are increased in scenarios with $P(k)$ enhancement. Thus,\nnonlinear mode coupling must be captured to enable $P(k)$ reconstruction using\nDM substructure.",

      "content": "A neutron star merger is the stellar collision of neutron stars. When two neutron stars fall into mutual orbit, they gradually spiral inward due to the loss of energy emitted as gravitational radiation. When they finally meet, their merger leads to the formation of either a more massive neutron star, or—if the mass of the remnant exceeds the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit—a black hole. The merger can create a magnetic field that is trillions of times stronger than that of Earth in a matter of one or two milliseconds. The immediate event creates a short gamma-ray burst visible over hundreds of millions, or even billions of light years.\nThe merger of neutron stars momentarily creates an environment of such extreme neutron flux that the r-process can occur. This reaction accounts for the nucleosynthesis of around half of the isotopes in elements heavier than iron.\nThe mergers also produce kilonovae, which are transient sources of isotropic longer wave electromagnetic radiation due to the radioactive decay of heavy r-process nuclei that are produced and ejected during the merger process. Kilonovae had been discussed as a possible r-process site since the reaction was first proposed in 1999, but the mechanism became widely accepted after multi-messenger event GW170817 was observed in 2017.",

      "content": "Pluto: Urasawa x Tezuka (stylized in all caps), or simply Pluto, is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Naoki Urasawa. It was serialized in Shogakukan's seinen manga magazine Big Comic Original from September 2003 to April 2009, with its chapters collected into eight tankōbon volumes. The series is based on Osamu Tezuka's Astro Boy, specifically \"The Greatest Robot on Earth\" story arc, and named after the arc's chief villain. Urasawa reinterprets the story as a suspenseful murder mystery starring Gesicht, a Europol robot detective trying to solve the case of a string of robot and human deaths. Takashi Nagasaki is credited as the series' co-author. Macoto Tezka, Tezuka's son, supervised the series, and Tezuka Productions is listed as having given cooperation.\nThe series was licensed and released in English in North America by Viz Media. A play adaptation directed by Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui opened in January 2015 and has been performed internationally. An original net animation (ONA) adaptation, produced by Genco with animation production services by Studio M2, premiered in its entirety on Netflix in October 2023.\nPluto was a critical and commercial success, winning several awards, including the ninth Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize, and selling over 10 million copies.",

The heaviest of the stable halogens, it exists at standard conditions as a semi-lustrous, non-metallic solid that melts to form a deep violet liquid at 114 °C (237 °F), and boils to a violet gas at 184 °C (363 °F). The element was discovered by the French chemist Bernard Courtois in 1811 and was named two years later by Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac, after the Ancient Greek Ιώδης, meaning 'violet'.\nIodine occurs in many oxidation states, including iodide (I−), iodate (IO−3), and the various periodate anions. As the heaviest essential mineral nutrient, iodine is required for the synthesis of thyroid hormones. Iodine deficiency affects about two billion people and is the leading preventable cause of intellectual disabilities.\nThe dominant producers of iodine today are Chile and Japan. Due to its high atomic number and ease of attachment to organic compounds, it has also found favour as a non-toxic radiocontrast material. Because of the specificity of its uptake by the human body, radioactive isotopes of iodine can also be used to treat thyroid cancer. Iodine is also used as a catalyst in the industrial production of acetic acid and some polymers.\nIt is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines.",

Earth has two such belts, and sometimes others may be temporarily created. The belts are named after James Van Allen, who published an article describing the belts in 1958. \nEarth's two main belts extend from an altitude of about 640 to 58,000 km (400 to 36,040 mi) above the surface, in which region radiation levels vary. The belts are in the inner region of Earth's magnetic field. They trap energetic electrons and protons. Other nuclei, such as alpha particles, are less prevalent. Most of the particles that form the belts are thought to come from the solar wind while others arrive as cosmic rays. By trapping the solar wind, the magnetic field deflects those energetic particles and protects the atmosphere from destruction.\nThe belts endanger satellites, which must have their sensitive components protected with adequate shielding if they spend significant time near that zone. Apollo astronauts going through the Van Allen belts received a very low and harmless dose of radiation.\nIn 2013, the Van Allen Probes detected a transient, third radiation belt, which persisted for four weeks.",

Thus, cosmic-ray transport\nis dominated by areas of low diffusion even if these areas occupy a relatively\nsmall, but not infinitesimal, fraction of the volume. On intermediate time\nscales, the cosmic rays experience transient effective sub-diffusion, as a\nresult of low-diffusion regions interrupting long flights through\nhigh-diffusion regions. In the simplified case of a two-phase medium, we show\nthat the extent and extremity of the sub-diffusivity of cosmic-ray transport is\ncontrolled by the spectral exponent of the distribution of patch sizes of each\nof the phases.

Here, we go beyond this\nsemi-classical treatment and formulate a toy quantum model of black hole\nevaporation that allows the black hole to evolve into a superposition of being\nfully evaporated and not fully evaporated, consistent with the Hawking\nparticles being in a coherent superposition of different energy levels. We\nmodel Hawking particle production by the repeated action of quantum-controlled\nunitaries, generating emission from the quantum black hole and accounting for a\nquantum coherent back-reaction on the black hole matter state. We show that the\nprobability of full annihilation of the black hole matter increases with time\nuntil the black hole is, asymptotically, fully evaporated in every branch of\nthe quantum superposition.

This effect can only be properly captured in 3D. Additionally,\nwe explore the impact of numerical resolution on ion energization, highlighting\nhow resolving small-scale turbulence -- on scales below the thermal ion\ngyroradius -- is essential for accurately modeling particle injection.

In this letter, we\npresent a total of \\textbf{67} early-phase normal SNe Ia from published papers\nand ongoing transient survey projects to systematically investigate their\nphotometric behaviors from very early time. We found that EExSNe Ia in our\nsample have longer rise and brighter peak luminosities compared to those of\nnon-EExSNe Ia. Moreover, EExSNe Ia commonly have ``red-bump\" features in the\nearly $B-V$ color while non-EExSNe Ia show blueward evolution from the very\nbeginning. Here, we propose that the thin-helium double-detonation scenario can\nphenomenologically explain the photometric diversities of normal SNe Ia\nconsidering different white dwarf-He-shell mass combinations and the\nviewing-angle effect, implying a unified explosion mechanism of normal-type SNe\nIa. To further testify the possible common origin of normal SNe Ia,\nsystematical studies of multiband photometric and spectral properties of\nearly-phase SNe Ia through the new generation wide-field time-domain survey\nfacilities and global real-time follow-up networks are highly demanded.",

The\nrare properties are the SN Ia ejecta interacting with a carbon-oxygen (CO)-rich\ncircumstellar material (CSM) at approximately 50 days post-explosion. In this\nDD-MED scenario, two massive CO white dwarfs (WDs), masses of M1=1.1Mo and\nM2=1, merge to leave a rapidly rotating lonely WD of about the Chandrasekhar\nmass. The merger process ejects 0.7Mo to form a nonspherical CO-rich CSM. At\nthe explosion, there is a lonely WD and a detached hydrogen- and\nhelium-deficient CSM.

Another problem lies within the mathematical framework of the Standard Model itself: the Standard Model is inconsistent with that of general relativity, and one or both theories break down under certain conditions, such as spacetime singularities like the Big Bang and black hole event horizons.\nTheories that lie beyond the Standard Model include various extensions of the standard model through supersymmetry, such as the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) and Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM), and entirely novel explanations, such as string theory, M-theory, and extra dimensions. As these theories tend to reproduce the entirety of current phenomena, the question of which theory is the right one, or at least the \"best step\" towards a Theory of Everything, can only be settled via experiments, and is one of the most active areas of research in both theoretical and experimental physics.",

The field also concerns itself with more fundamental moral questions, such as the value of abiotic environments in space, the intrinsic value of extraterrestrial life, and how humans should treat extraterrestrial non-intelligent life (like microbes) and extraterrestrial intelligent life (and whether this distinction should be made in the first place).\nAstroethical issues are often discussed as elements of broader issues such as general environmental protection and imperialism.

To resolve this inconsistency,\nwe develop a drift-kinetic model that explicitly captures localized losses\noccurring on timescales similar to the azimuthal drift period. We demonstrate\nthat such localized loss regions can synchronize the azimuthal Fourier modes of\nthe particle distribution function, producing apparent refilling through\nphase-space synchronization rather than diffusion. The resulting governing\nequations are mathematically equivalent to a generalized Kuramoto model, widely\nused to describe synchronization phenomena.

RSGs likely all have some amount of circumstellar\nmatter (CSM), through nominal mass loss, although evidence exists that some\nRSGs must experience enhanced mass loss during their lifetimes.

The typical\nspectral energy distribution (SED) for such RSGs can generally be fit with a\ncool photospheric model, whereas the more luminous RSG progenitors of more\nluminous SNe II-P tend to require a greater quantity of dust in their CSM to\naccount for their SEDs.

The paradox first appeared in print in a 1963 paper by Carl Sagan and the paradox has since been fully characterized by scientists including Michael H. Hart. Early formulations of the paradox have also been identified in writings by Bernard Le Bovier de Fontenelle (1686) and Jules Verne (1865).\nThere have been many attempts to resolve the Fermi paradox, such as suggesting that intelligent extraterrestrial beings are extremely rare, that the lifetime of such civilizations is short, or that they exist but (for various reasons) humans see no evidence.",

      "content": "The high longitudinal electric fields generated in plasma wakefields are very\nattractive for a new generation of high gradient plasma based accelerators. On\nthe other hand, the strong transverse fields increase the demand for a proper\nmatching device in order to avoid the spoiling of beam transverse quality. A\nsolution can be provided by the use of a plasma ramp, a region at the plasma\ninjection/extraction with smoothly increasing/decreasing plasma density. The\ntransport of a beam inside a plasma ramp, beside its parameters, depends on the\nprofile of the ramp itself. Establishing the transfer matrix for a plasma ramp\nrepresents a very useful tool in order to evaluate the beam evolution in the\nplasma. In this paper a study of a cosine squared ramp is presented. An\napproximate solution of the transverse equation of motion is evaluated and\nexploited to provide a simple transfer matrix for the plasma ramp. The transfer\nmatrix is then employed to demonstrate that this kind of ramp has the effect to\nminimize the emittance growth due to betatron dephasing. The behavior of a\nsquared cosine plasma ramp will be compared with an experimentally measured\nplasma ramp profile in order to validate the applicability of the transfer\nmatrix to real cases.",

By implementing Bayesian analysis on experimental data of the\njet invariant mass from exclusive $W/Z+$jet events and inclusive jet events in\n$pp$ collisions at RHIC and LHC, where collisional energy increases by a factor\nof up to $65$ from RHIC to LHC, we ensure the analysis covers a wide range of\ndata.

We find that the contribution from initial\nsoft-gluon radiation is negligible, and the hadronization effect dominates in\nthe small-$R$ region, while underlying events provide the dominant contribution\nin the large-$R$ region. Moreover, when only hadronization effects are\nconsidered, our results successfully describe the jet mass data measured in\n$e^+e^-$ collisions, where only hadronization effects are expected to be\npresent.

Since a selection method of initial\nvalue affects the convergence of the solution, developing an effective method\nto find an initial guess is required. In this work, B\\'ezier curves, which can\ndescribe complicated curves and surfaces, are utilized to find the initial\nguess. First, the given problems are transformed into B\\'ezier curves forms,\nand B\\'ezier curves' control points, which can handle the shape of curves, are\nselected by solving the system of nonlinear equations. Finally, the initial\nguess is obtained by substituting the calculated control points to B\\'ezier\ncurves. To validate the performance of the proposed method, numerical\nsimulations are conducted with respect to three kinds of orbits, which are from\ncircular to highly elliptical orbit (HEO). The proposed method is compared to\nthe general shooting method. The comparison results show that the initial guess\ncalculated by B\\'ezier curves makes finding the solution more efficient in\nterms of computational time and iterations.

This increase in extreme climate conditions has the potential to\nfurther alter vegetation productivity (called gross primary production or GPP)\nand carbon uptake capacity. Here, we use a global Earth system model to\ninvestigate the impacts of (a) CO2 forcing and (b) CO2 and LULCC forcing on the\nintensity, frequency, and duration of extreme events in GPP. We found that the\nnegative extremes in GPP, which are associated with higher losses in carbon\nuptake than expected, increase at a higher rate than positive GPP extremes; and\nthis rate rises with LULCC forcing. The most dominant climate driver causing\nthe GPP extremes is soil moisture anomalies, which are triggered by extremes in\nprecipitation and temperature. The lagged responses of climate drivers on GPP\nextremes vary with the drivers and spatial location.

It is also confirmed that TRAPPIST-1e lacks a cloud-free hydrogen-dominated atmosphere, meaning it is more likely to have a compact atmosphere like the terrestrial planets in the Solar System. \nIn November 2018, researchers determined that of the seven exoplanets in the multi-planetary system, TRAPPIST-1e has the best chance of being an Earth-like ocean planet, and the one most worthy of further study regarding habitability.

It was constructed without engines or a functional heat shield. As a result, it was not capable of spaceflight.\nOriginally, Enterprise had been intended to be refitted for orbital flight to become the second space-rated orbiter in service. However, during the construction of Space Shuttle Columbia, details of the final design changed, making it simpler and less costly to build  Challenger around a body frame that had been built as a test article. Similarly, Enterprise was considered for refit to replace Challenger after the latter was destroyed, but  Endeavour was built from structural spares instead.\nEnterprise was restored and placed on display in 2003 at the Smithsonian's new Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Virginia. Following the retirement of the Space Shuttle fleet,  Discovery replaced Enterprise at the Udvar-Hazy Center, and Enterprise was transferred to the Intrepid Museum in New York City, where it has been on display since July 2012.",

      "content": "We investigate the observational signatures of outflow rotation in\nprotostellar systems using magnetohydrodynamics simulations of protostellar\nevolution with radiative transfer and synthetic observation. The velocity\ngradient perpendicular to the outflow axis indicates outflow rotation. The\nrotation signature is clearly seen in the moment 1 map and a position-velocity\n(PV) diagram across an outflow lobe made from our model with an inclination\nangle of i>~85{degree sign}, as in observational studies of protostellar\noutflows. Velocity projection with lower inclinations distorts the moment 1 map\nbecause the outflow vertical (propagation) velocity contributes more to the\nline-of-sight velocity, leading to an incorrect outflow axis direction. The PV\ndiagram adopting the incorrect outflow axis shows no clear velocity gradient.\nThese effects may prevent us from identifying outflow rotation. Our analysis\nimplies that rotational signatures can be obscured in ~2/3 to ~4/5 of the total\noutflow population (i<70{degree sign}-80{degree sign}), regardless of the\nevolutionary stage. Complicated structures in observed outflows make it\ndifficult to determine the outflow, which may result in the apparent\nnon-detection of outflow rotation.",

In this study, we investigate the\nseasonal variability of snow distribution and its impact on surface albedo and\nenergy fluxes across the marginal ice zone (MIZ), using a unique dataset from\nfive shipborne expeditions conducted between 2019 and 2024. High-resolution\nvisible and infrared imagery, combined with field observations and\nmeteorological data, reveal that even modest snow fractions substantially\nincrease surface reflectivity and suppress conductive heat transfer. Our\nresults demonstrate that simplified binary assumptions-such as assigning dry\nsnow in winter and bare ice in summer-systematically misrepresent surface\nconditions, introducing significant biases in modelled radiative and turbulent\nfluxes. By explicitly resolving fractional snow cover, we show that surface\nalbedo and energy exchange respond nonlinearly to snow-ice composition, with\nimplications for sea ice growth, melt, and climate feedbacks. These findings\nadvocate for a revision of current model parameterizations, emphasizing the\nneed for multi-component surface schemes that reflect the observed\nheterogeneity of the Antarctic MIZ.",

      "content": "Trajectory optimization is the process of designing a trajectory that minimizes (or maximizes) some measure of performance while satisfying a set of constraints. Generally speaking, trajectory optimization is a technique for computing an open-loop solution to an optimal control problem. It is often used for systems where computing the full closed-loop solution is not required, impractical or impossible. If a trajectory optimization problem can be solved at a rate given by the inverse of the Lipschitz constant, then it can be used iteratively to generate a closed-loop solution in the sense of Caratheodory. If only the first step of the trajectory is executed for an infinite-horizon problem, then this is known as Model Predictive Control (MPC).\nAlthough the idea of trajectory optimization has been around for hundreds of years (calculus of variations, brachystochrone problem), it only became practical for real-world problems with the advent of the computer. Many of the original applications of trajectory optimization were in the aerospace industry, computing rocket and missile launch trajectories. More recently, trajectory optimization has also been used in a wide variety of industrial process and robotics applications.",

Accurate\nreconstruction methods are essential for investigating the properties of\nprimary particles.

This paper also presents an energy\nreconstruction in which we account for the effects of geosynchrotron radiation\nin inclined air showers, we implement an air density correction in the energy\nreconstruction, resulting in a 10\\% resolution in energy estimation.

The animation of the film combines traditional hand-drawn created animation with the extensive use of computer-generated imagery.\nThe film tells the story of a young man who receives a mission to save humanity and protect the giant ship that can create a new planet, after the hostile alien species have destroyed the planet Earth. Along the way, he joins up with a ship's crew and their captain, who help him race against time and find the ship, before the aliens can destroy it.\nTheatrically released on June 16, 2000, by 20th Century Fox in the United States as the third and final project produced by Fox Animation Studios, the film received mixed reviews from critics with praise for its visuals and animation but criticism for its characters and story. The film was also a box office failure, grossing only $36.8 million against a budget of $75–90 million, though it later became a cult classic.",

A\ncommon prior assumption is that planetary accretion commences after the infall\nof gas and solids to the circumstellar disk ended. However, observational\nevidence indicates that accretion may begin earlier. We propose that compact\nsystems are surviving remnants of planet accretion that occurred during the\nfinal phases of infall. In regions of the disk experiencing ongoing infall, the\nplanetary mass is set by the balance between accretion of infalling solids and\nthe increasingly rapid inward migration driven by the surrounding gas as the\nplanet grows. This balance selects for similarly-sized planets whose mass is a\nfunction of infall and disk conditions. We show that infall-produced planets\ncan survive until the gas disk disperses and migration ends, and that across a\nbroad range of conditions, the mass of surviving systems is regulated to a few\n10^{-5} to 10^{-4} times the host star's mass.

Rather than the\ntwo-stream instability, this truncation destabilizes the distribution and leads\nto the generation of Langmuir waves via a linear instability; we confine our\nanalysis to this linear regime and do not take into account the back reaction\nof the generated Langmuir waves on the electron distribution, which is\nnonlinear.

      "content": "In this work we study a scale invariant gravity theory containing two scalar\nfields, dust particles and a measure defined from degrees of freedom\nindependent of the metric. The integration of the degrees of freedom that\ndefine the measure spontaneously break the scale symmetry, leaving us in the\nEinstein frame with an effective potential that is dependent on the density of\nthe particles. The potential contains three flat regions, one for inflation,\nanother for early dark energy and the third for late dark energy. At a certain\npoint, as the matter dilutes, tunneling from the early dark energy to the late\ndark energy can start efficiently. This mechanism naturally alleviated the\nobserved Hubble tension by modifying the sound horizon prior to recombination\nwhile preserving late-time cosmology. Moreover, the model predictions are\nconsistent with observations from the reduced CMB, BAO, and local measurement\nof $H_0$, providing a coherent and unified description of the universe. In this\ncontext, the Bayesian analysis of these datasets confirms the viability of our\nscenario, with the best-fit parameters indicating an early dark energy fraction\nof approximately 30$\\%$ at a redshift of $z'=5000$.",

She was believed to be one of the followers of Artemis (Diana for the Romans) who attracted Zeus. Many versions of Callisto's story survive. According to some writers, Zeus transformed himself into the figure of Artemis to pursue Callisto, and she slept with him believing Zeus to be Artemis.\nShe became pregnant and when this was eventually discovered, she was expelled from Artemis's group, after which a furious Hera, the wife of Zeus, transformed her into a bear, although in some versions, Artemis is the one to give her an ursine form. Later, just as she was about to be killed by her son when he was hunting, she was set among the stars as Ursa Major (\"the Great Bear\") by Zeus. She was the bear-mother of the Arcadians, through her son Arcas by Zeus.\nIn other accounts, the birth mother of Arcas was called Megisto, daughter of Ceteus, son of Lycaon, or else Themisto, daughter of Inachus.\nThe fourth Galilean moon of Jupiter and a main belt asteroid are named after Callisto.",

It was dubbed the Great Comet of 1996; its passage to within 0.1 AU (15 Gm) of the Earth on 25 March was one of the closest cometary approaches of the previous 200 years. Reaching an apparent visual magnitude of zero and spanning nearly 80°, Hyakutake appeared very bright in the night sky and was widely seen around the world. The comet temporarily upstaged the much anticipated Comet Hale–Bopp, which was approaching the inner Solar System at the time.\nHyakutake is a long-period comet that passed perihelion on 1 May 1996. Before its most recent passage through the Solar System, its orbital period was about 17,000 years, but the gravitational perturbation of the giant planets has increased this period to 70,000 years. This is the first comet to have an X-ray emission detected, which is most likely the result of ionised solar wind particles interacting with neutral atoms in the coma of the comet. The Ulysses spacecraft fortuitously crossed the comet's tail at a distance of more than 500 million km (3.3 AU; 310 million mi) from the nucleus, showing that Hyakutake had the longest tail known for a comet.",

The X-43 is the fastest jet-powered aircraft on record at approximately Mach 9.6.\nA winged booster rocket with the X-43 placed on top, called a \"stack\", was drop launched from a Boeing B-52 Stratofortress.

The first X-43A was destroyed after malfunctioning in flight in 2001.

In contrast, stars on\nbox and disk orbits show little azimuthal variation, effectively smoothing the\noverall velocity distribution.

      "content": "Line-intensity mapping (LIM) is emerging as a powerful probe of the\nhigh-redshift Universe, with a growing number of LIM experiments targeting\nvarious spectral lines deep into the epochs of reionization and cosmic dawn. A\nkey remaining challenge is the consistent and efficient modeling of the diverse\nemission lines and of the observables of different surveys. Here, we present\noLIMpus, a fully analytical effective model to study LIM auto- and cross- power\nspectra. Our work builds on the 21-cm effective model presented in Zeus21,\napplying it to star-forming lines and improving it in different aspects. Our\ncode accounts for shot noise and linear redshift-space distortions and it\nincludes by default prescriptions for OII, OIII, H$\\alpha$, H$\\beta$, CII, CO\nline luminosities, together with the 21-cm model inherited from Zeus21. Beyond\nauto- and cross-power spectra, oLIMpus can produce mock coeval boxes and\nlightcones, and with a computational time of $\\sim s$ it is ideal for\nparameter-space exploration and inference. Its modular implementation makes it\neasy to customize and extend, enabling various applications, such as MCMC\nanalyses and consistent multi-line cross-correlations.",

The second model\nalso considers an interaction of the evolutionary dark energy with the matter\ncomponent, postulated via the conservation of the sum of their ideal\nenergy-momentum tensors. These two models are then compared \\textit{via} the\ndiagnostic tool of the effective running Hubble constant, with the binned data\nof the so-called ``Master sample'' for the Type Ia Supernovae. The comparison\nprocedures, based on a standard MCMC analysis, led to a clear preference of\ndata for the dark energy - matter interaction model, which is associated to a\nphantom matter equation of state parameter (very close to $-1$) when, being\nleft free by data (it has a flat posterior), it is fixed in order to reproduce\nthe decreasing power-law behavior of the effective running Hubble constant,\nalready discussed in literature.",

We\npropose a systematic prescription to characterize temporal entanglement in\nrelativistic quantum field theory in a general state for an arbitrary subregion\non a flat, constant-time slice in a flat spacetime. Our prescriptions starts\nwith the standard entanglement entropy of a spatial subregion and amounts to\ntransporting the unchanged subregion to boosted time slices all the way across\nthe light cone when it becomes in general a complex characterization of the\ncorresponding temporal subregion. For holographic quantum field theories, our\nprescription amounts to an analytic continuation of all codimension-two bulk\nextremal surfaces satisfying the homology constraint and picking the one with\nthe smallest real value of the area as the leading saddle point. We implement\nthis prescription for the holographic conformal field theories in thermal\nstates on both a two-dimensional Lorentzian cylinder and three-dimensional\nMinkowski space, and show that it leads to results with self-consistent\nphysical properties of temporal entanglement.",

Our\nin-house developed experimental setup enables precise measurement of packing\ndensity and in-situ shear stress via a Taylor-Couette rheometer. We find that\nthe jamming transition occurs at lower packing density in microgravity than on\nEarth, confirming that gravity promotes densification. Rheological measurements\nfurther reveal that in microgravity, the lack of a secondary force field and\npredominance of cohesive interparticle forces increase the stress needed for\ngranular media to flow. These findings highlight gravity's dual role in\nenhancing both compaction and flow, and demonstrate the need for tailored\ngranular models, valid in low- and microgravity environments.",

This radiation can be observed only when a beam of emission is pointing toward Earth (similar to the way a lighthouse can be seen only when the light is pointed in the direction of an observer), and is responsible for the pulsed appearance of emission. Neutron stars are very dense and have short, regular rotational periods. This produces a very precise interval between pulses that ranges from milliseconds to seconds for an individual pulsar. Pulsars are one of the candidates for the source of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (see also centrifugal mechanism of acceleration).\nPulsars’ highly regular pulses make them very useful tools for astronomers. For example, observations of a pulsar in a binary neutron star system were used to indirectly confirm the existence of gravitational radiation. The first extrasolar planets were discovered in 1992 around a pulsar, specifically PSR B1257+12. In 1983, certain types of pulsars were detected that, at that time, exceeded the accuracy of atomic clocks in keeping time.",

      "content": "Radio astronomy is a subfield of astronomy that studies celestial objects using radio waves. It started in 1933, when Karl Jansky at Bell Telephone Laboratories reported radiation coming from the Milky Way. Subsequent observations have identified a number of different sources of radio emission. These include stars and galaxies, as well as entirely new classes of objects, such as radio galaxies, quasars, pulsars, and masers. The discovery of the cosmic microwave background radiation, regarded as evidence for the Big Bang theory, was made through radio astronomy.\nRadio astronomy is conducted using large radio antennas referred to as radio telescopes, that are either used alone, or with multiple linked telescopes utilizing the techniques of radio interferometry and aperture synthesis. The use of interferometry allows radio astronomy to achieve high angular resolution, as the resolving power of an interferometer is set by the distance between its components, rather than the size of its components.\nRadio astronomy differs from radar astronomy in that the former is a passive observation (i.e., receiving only) and the latter an active one (transmitting and receiving).",

We\nmodel Io's tidal deformation by treating its mantle as a two-phase (solid and\nmelt) system. By combining poro-viscous and poro-elastic compaction theories in\na Maxwell framework with a consistent model of tidal and self-gravitation, we\nproduce the first self-consistent evaluation of Io's tidal heating rate due to\nshearing, compaction, and Darcy flow.\n  We find that Darcy dissipation can potentially exceed shear heating, but only\nfor large (0.05 to 0.2) melt fractions, and if the grain size is large or melt\nviscosity ultra-low. Since grain sizes larger than 1~cm are unlikely, this\nsuggests that Darcy dissipation is secondary to shear dissipation. Compaction\ndissipation is maximised when the asthenosphere is highly resistive to\nisotropic stresses, but contributes at most 1% of Io's observed heating rate.\n  This work represents a crucial step toward a self-consistent quantitative\ntheory for the dynamics of Io's partially molten interior.",

The implementation is written in C and is ported to run on FreeRTOS, Zephyr and POSIX and pthreads-based operating systems such as Linux. The three-letter acronym CSP was adopted as an abbreviation for CAN Space Protocol because the first MAC-layer driver was written for CAN-bus. The physical layer has since been extended to include several other technologies, and the name was therefore extended to the more general CubeSat Space Protocol without changing the abbreviation.\nThe protocol and the implementation is still actively maintained by Johan de Claville Christiansen, Space Inventor, GomSpace, and Space Cubics.

The planar\nphase is unique to the unusual density profile of the He-detonated layer in\ncomparison to the steep profile at a stellar edge as is usually considered for\nshock breakout. The shock cooling emission can be modified by recombination,\nand we explore these effects. All together, we expect an initial flash\ndominated by the planar phase of $\\sim6\\times10^{43}\\,{\\rm erg\\,s^{-1}}$, which\nlasts ~5 s in the soft X-rays. This is followed by ~12-24 hrs of shock cooling\nat a luminosity of $3-10\\times10^{40}\\,{\\rm erg\\,s^{-1}}$ in the optical/UV. We\ndiscuss prospects for detection of this early DD emission with current and\nupcoming surveys.",

      "content": "A launch vehicle is typically a rocket-powered vehicle designed to carry a payload (a crewed spacecraft or satellites) from Earth's surface or lower atmosphere to outer space. The most common form is the ballistic missile-shaped multistage rocket, but the term is more general and also encompasses vehicles like the Space Shuttle. Most launch vehicles operate from a launch pad, supported by a launch control center and systems such as vehicle assembly and fueling. Launch vehicles are engineered with advanced aerodynamics and technologies, which contribute to high operating costs.\nAn orbital launch vehicle must lift its payload at least to the boundary of space, approximately 150 km (93 mi) and accelerate it to a horizontal velocity of at least 7,814 m/s (17,480 mph). Suborbital vehicles launch their payloads to lower velocity or are launched at elevation angles greater than horizontal.\nPractical orbital launch vehicles use chemical propellants such as solid fuel, liquid hydrogen, kerosene, liquid oxygen, or hypergolic propellants.\nLaunch vehicles are classified by their orbital payload capacity, ranging from small-, medium-, heavy- to super-heavy lift.",

The\nnoniterative FAM is used to derive equations of quasiparticle random-phase\napproximation (QRPA) for neutron-induced inelastic scatterings to both the\ndiscrete and continuum states in a consistent manner. The Skyrme force is\nemployed as an interaction between the projectile neutron with nucleons inside\nthe target nucleus. We apply this method to the neutron-induced reaction on\n208Pb. We demonstrate that the calculated differential inelastic scattering\ncross sections to low-lying states reproduce available experimental data\nwithout any phenomenological parameters that are often introduced in\nconventional DWBA calculations. The calculated double differential cross\nsection to the continuum state also agrees with the experimental data in the\nenergy region relevant to the direct and pre-equilibrium processes. These\nresults are used to investigate the spin distribution of the populated states\nin the residual nucleus.",

Created by writer Chris Claremont and artist Paul Smith, the character first appeared in The Uncanny X-Men #169 (May 1983). She belongs to a subspecies of humans known as mutants, who are born with superhuman abilities. She is also known under the codename White Knight.\nCallisto was the leader of New York City's subterranean mutant settlement, the Morlocks, a group of mutants who are unable to assimilate into human society. However, she lost that position in a duel against Storm. The latter subsequently entrusted the group to Callisto as her representative. Although they once could not tolerate each other's presence, they have since developed a relationship based on mutual respect.\nSince her original introduction in comics, the character has been featured in various other Marvel-licensed products, including films and animated television series. Callisto made her live-action debut in the 2006 film, X-Men: The Last Stand, portrayed by Dania Ramirez. She also appeared in the 2024 Marvel Cinematic Universe film Deadpool & Wolverine, portrayed by Chloe Kibble.",

The azimuthal components of the complex scalar fields asymptote to a\nconstant rate of rolling at late times, reminiscent of motion around the\ninfinite staircase of M.C.

The\nresulting centripetal acceleration drives the radial components of the field\naway from the minimum of the potential, and the system generates a\nself-sustaining and constant Hubble rate at late times, even when tuning the\nminimum of the potential such that the classical vacuum energy is vanishing.\nThis result evidences the potential to generate novel and physically relevant\ndynamics that are unique to pseudo-Hermitian field theories, and that their\nregimes of broken antilinear symmetry can be physically relevant in dynamical\nspacetimes.",

Tolkien's legendarium combines aspects of Christian theology and metaphysics with pre-modern cosmological concepts in the flat Earth paradigm, along with the modern spherical Earth view of the Solar System.\nThe created world, Eä, includes the planet Arda, corresponding to the Earth. It is created flat, with the dwelling of the godlike Valar at its centre. When this is marred by the evil Vala Melkor, the world is reshaped, losing its perfect symmetry, and the Valar move to Valinor, but the Elves can still sail there from Middle-earth. When Men try to go there, hoping for immortality, Valinor and its continent of Aman are removed from Arda, which is reshaped as a round world. Scholars have compared the implied cosmology with that of Tolkien's religion, Catholicism, and of medieval poetry such as Pearl or Dante's Paradiso, where there are three parts, Earth, Purgatory or the Earthly Paradise, and Heaven or the Celestial Paradise. Scholars have debated the nature of evil in Middle-earth, arguing whether it is the absence of good (the Boethian position) or equally as powerful as good (the Manichaean view).",

The competing forces of gravity, which is stronger at the lower end, and the upward centrifugal pseudo-force (it is actually the inertia of the counterweight that creates the tension on the space side), which is stronger at the upper end, would result in the cable being held up, under tension, and stationary over a single position on Earth.

      "content": "A persistent paradox complicates the study of plasma-irradiated thin films,\nwhere bimodal grain distributions and ambiguous scaling laws, roughly shifting\nbetween $\\Phi^{-1/2}$ and $\\Phi^{-1}$, or a general inverse dependence on\nplasma flux, are empirical yet remain theoretically unreconciled. Existing\nmodels fail to unify noise-driven evolution, defect saturation kinetics, and\nnucleation-loss balance within a single, self-consistent formalism. This work\nresolves these discrepancies by developing the first exact analytical theory\nfor this system. We derive the closed-form steady-state grain area\ndistribution, $P_{ss}(A)$, establish the precise dimensionless threshold for\nbimodality onset at $\\Pi_c = 4/(3\\sqrt{3})$, and demonstrate that defect\nsaturation physics mandate a universal $\\langle A \\rangle \\propto \\kappa^2\n\\Phi^{-1} e^{+2E_b/k_B T_s}$ scaling law. The framework reveals how competition\nbetween stochastic impingement and deterministic growth triggers microstructure\nfragmentation, resolving long-standing ambiguities in irradiation-induced\nsurface evolution and providing a predictive foundation for materials\nprocessing.",

The\nphysics and predictability of MJO propagation remain elusive, partly because of\nlittle attention to untangling roles of multi-scale processes relevant to the\nMJO. Here, we reveal the chaotic nature of MJO propagation arising from\ncross-scale nonlinear interactions, based on 4,000-member ensemble global\ncloud-system-resolving simulations of two MJO events. Against conventional\nlinearized thinking, multiple regimes with distinct timings of MJO propagation\nemerge under a single atmosphere-ocean background. The bifurcation emergence\ndepends critically on the equatorial asymmetry of climatological sea surface\ntemperature. Selection of the bifurcated regimes is probabilistic, influenced\nby whether tropical-extratropical interplay promotes moistening associated with\nwestward-propagating tropical waves over the western Pacific.

The internal processes of a planet are partly responsible for its atmosphere, and so they are also a determining factor in a planet's capacity to support life.\nAs there are over 5,600 different exoplanets and more being discovered every year, it is difficult to group them by interior type. However, NASA has broadly classified them based on their interior and exterior as a gas giant, super earth, Neptune-like, or terrestrial. Within each of these groups are several sub classifications (\"hot Jupiter's\", \"mini-Neptune's\", etc.) with many theoretical exoplanet interiors being hypothesized (\"chthonian planets\", \"water worlds\", planets with tiny cores or massive mantles, etc.); however, there is no standardized classification of exoplanet interiors.",

Chorus waves are\nknown to accelerate these electrons via resonant interactions, but these\ninteractions are inherently nonlinear and coherent.

Two competing paradigms,\nnonlinear advection and diffusive transport, have been debated for decades.\nHere, we address this controversy using large-scale first-principles\nsimulations that self-consistently generate realistic chorus wave fields,\ncoupled with test particle modeling. We find that electron motion is coherent\non short timescales comparable to or less than a bounce period but becomes\nstochastic over longer timescales due to phase decorrelation. The resulting\ntransport coefficients support the use of quasilinear diffusion theory for\nlong-term evolution.

      "content": "Particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations are essential for studying kinetic plasma\nprocesses, but they often suffer from statistical noise, especially in plasmas\nwith fast flows. We have also found that the typical central difference scheme\nused in PIC codes to solve Maxwell's equations produces spurious oscillations\nnear discontinuities, which can lead to unphysical solutions. In this work, we\npresent numerical techniques to address these challenges within the\nsemi-implicit PIC code FLEKS, which is based on the Gauss's Law-satisfying\nEnergy-Conserving Semi-Implicit Particle-in-Cell method (GL-ECSIM). First, we\nintroduce a Lax-Friedrichs-type diffusion term with a flux limiter into the\nMaxwell solver to suppress unphysical oscillations near discontinuities.\nSecond, we propose a novel approach for calculating the current density in the\ncomoving frame, which significantly reduces particle noise in simulations with\nfast plasma flows. Numerical tests are presented to demonstrate the\neffectiveness of these methods in mitigating spurious oscillations and noise in\nshock and magnetic reconnection simulations.",

Although there are many applications for pulsar timing arrays, the best known is the use of an array of millisecond pulsars to detect and analyse long-wavelength (i.e., low-frequency) gravitational wave background. Such a detection would entail a detailed measurement of a gravitational wave (GW) signature, like the GW-induced quadrupolar correlation between arrival times of pulses emitted by different millisecond pulsar pairings that depends only on the pairings' angular separations in the sky. Larger arrays may be better for GW detection because the quadrupolar spatial correlations induced by GWs can be better sampled by many more pulsar pairings. With such a GW detection, millisecond pulsar timing arrays would open a new low-frequency window in gravitational-wave astronomy to peer into potential ancient astrophysical sources and early Universe processes, inaccessible by any other means.",

Low data availability for some biological and engineering problems limit the robustness of conventional machine learning models used for these applications. The prior knowledge of general physical laws acts in the training of neural networks (NNs) as a regularization agent that limits the space of admissible solutions, increasing the generalizability of the function approximation. This way, embedding this prior information into a neural network results in enhancing the information content of the available data, facilitating the learning algorithm to capture the right solution and to generalize well even with a low amount of training examples.

In H$\\alpha$ emission, the nebula appears as a crescent shaped, broken\nring of clumpy emission some $9' \\times 13'$ in angular size centered to the\nsouth and west of the WR star. At a Gaia estimated distance of 4.27 kpc, the\nnebula has physical dimensions of $11 \\times 16$ pc making it one of the larger\nknown ejecta rich WR ring nebulae. Our [O III] image also show considerable\nsurrounding faint nebulosity much of which may be unrelated to the WR star. A\ncomparison of the nebula's optical appearance with that seen in WISE 22 $\\mu$m\ndata shows infrared coincidence with the nebula's brightest [O III] emission\nfeatures. Deep H$\\alpha$ and [O III] images like those presented here suggests\nthat new and substantially deeper imaging reconnaissance of WR star nebulae\ncompared to earlier surveys may lead to additional WR ring nebula detections,\nthereby enhancing our understanding on the frequency and formation of WR ring\nnebulae.",

Each light curve is carefully\nscrutinized and its properties are summarized in a set of five parameters. The\npicture that had been sketched in an earlier work is clarified and new features\nare revealed. In particular, the evolution on the AGB of stars having not yet\nexperienced a third dredge-up event is shown to go together with a closely\nrelated path followed by the light curve in the parameter space. Moreover,\nevidence is found for the existence of two different types of light curves for\nstars having experienced dredge-up events strong enough for their impact to be\ndetectable. Interpretations are proposed, however often too speculative to be\nfirmly ascertained: the results presented raise several unanswered questions\nand point to the need for new observations and analyses, suggesting that light\ncurves still carry more messages and information than has been currently\npossible to decrypt.",

Coincidentally, when the song reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, it remained in the top spot for one week.\nIn Canada, \"One Week\" reached No. 3 on the RPM 100 Hit Tracks Chart, while worldwide, the song peaked within the top 10 of the charts in Iceland and the United Kingdom. The band has not equaled this level of US chart success since, though singles \"It's All Been Done\", from the same album, and \"Pinch Me\", from their subsequent album Maroon, both broke the top 50 of the US Hot 100.

Rocket vehicles carry their own oxidiser, unlike most combustion engines, so rocket engines can be used in a vacuum, and they can achieve great speed, beyond escape velocity. Vehicles commonly propelled by rocket engines include missiles, artillery shells, ballistic missiles and rockets of any size, from tiny fireworks to man-sized weapons to huge spaceships.\nCompared to other types of jet engine, rocket engines are the lightest and have the highest thrust, but are the least propellant-efficient (they have the lowest specific impulse). For thermal rockets, pure hydrogen, the lightest of all elements, gives the highest exhaust velocity, but practical chemical rockets produce a mix of heavier species, reducing the exhaust velocity.",

      "title": "Big-bang firing order",
      "content": "A big bang engine has an unconventional firing order designed so that some of the power strokes occur simultaneously or in close succession. This is achieved by changing the ignition timing, changing or re-timing the camshaft, and sometimes in combination with a change in crankpin angle. The goal is to change the power delivery characteristics of the engine. A regular-firing multi-cylinder engine fires at approximately even intervals, giving a smooth-running engine. Because a big-bang engine has uneven power delivery, it tends to run rougher and generates more vibration than an even-firing engine.\nAn early big bang application and possibly the source of its discovery is reputed to be American west coast desert racing off-road and also flat track racing motorcycles in the 1960s, where it was thought that large-capacity single-cylinder engine bikes had better traction compared to twin-cylinder engined bikes with similar power, hence 360-degree crankshaft twins were reconfigured to fire both cylinders at the same time, giving the same power impulse interval as a single.",

Ultimately, a scaled-down version of Freedom evolved into the US Orbital Segment (USOS) of the International Space Station (ISS).\nBy the time the project was canceled, NASA had already invested approximately $11 billion into Space Station Freedom, however some of that work would benefit the ISS. As originally envisioned, the station would have been collaborative project involving four participating space agencies: NASA (United States), NASDA (Japan), ESA (Europe), and CSA (Canada).

Single-cell protocols have much higher levels of noise than bulk RNA-seq, so a common step in a single-cell transcriptomics workflow is the clustering of cells into subgroups.  Clustering can contend with this inherent variation by combining the signal from many cells, while allowing for the identification of cell types. However, some differences in gene expression between cells are the result of dynamic processes such as the cell cycle, cell differentiation, or response to an external stimuli. Trajectory inference seeks to characterize such differences by placing cells along a continuous path that represents the evolution of the process rather than dividing cells into discrete clusters. In some methods this is done by projecting cells onto an axis called pseudotime which represents the progression through the process.",

Additionally, we compared velocity shifts in the spectrum of the\nultra-hot Jupiter WASP-76b using previously reported and newly measured transit\ntimes.

I showcase the resulting publicly available Exhaustive\nSymbolic Regression algorithm on three open problems in astrophysics: the\nexpansion history of the universe, the effective behaviour of gravity in\ngalaxies and the potential of the inflaton field. In each case the algorithm\nidentifies many functions superior to the literature standards. This general\npurpose methodology should find widespread utility in science and beyond.",

Based on\nthis set of master formulas we derive a comprehensive curvature tool-kit for\napplications in generalised geometry. This includes decompositions for the full\ngeneralised Ricci tensor, the generalised Ricci tensor, and three generalised\nscalar-valued curvature invariants, two of which are new.",

To the best of our\nknowledge, this work represents the first application of a multiscale plasma\nsolver to this problem. In our approach, neutrals, ions, and electrons are\ntreated as distinct species, with electrons modeled beyond the conventional\nfluid approximation. The numerical implementation is validated through\ncomparison with reference solutions for neutral hypersonic flow around a\nsphere, as well as benchmarking against experimental data for a Mach 4.75\npre-ionized argon flow. In both cases, the UGKWP results show good agreement\nwith the reference and experimental data.

The effective pressure in Gauss-Bonnet gravity is\ndifferent with the one in Einstein gravity only when $N\\geq6$, and in this\ncase, the effective pressure is not always negative and has a minimum. The\neffective pressure in Lovelock gravity can have multiple zero-points and\nextreme points. The effective pressure in different dimensions has interesting\nrelations. We also find that under certain condition, the effective pressure is\nequivalent with the `ordinary' pressure $p$ of the perfect fluid, and this\ncondition do not depend on the specific choice of gravitational theories.",

The field of computational origami has also grown significantly since its inception in the 1990s with Robert Lang's TreeMaker algorithm to assist in the precise folding of bases. Computational origami results either address origami design or origami foldability. In origami design problems, the goal is to design an object that can be folded out of paper given a specific target configuration.

As\na first step, we present a series of two-dimensional general-relativistic\nsimulations of BBH in a wind tunnel for an asymptotically homogeneous scalar\nfield background. We extract the drag forces, torque, mass and charge accretion\nacting on the binary, and analyze their dependence on the binary separation,\nvelocity and the scalar field parameters. We find that the binary's drag is not\na simple superposition of two isolated black holes; the presence of a companion\nmodifies the gravitational wake and yields significant nonlinearities.

The dynamics of atmospheric systems are assumed to be equation-free,\nwith the linear evolution of observables derived from measured historical\nlong-term time-series data snapshots, such as monthly sea surface temperature\nrecords, to construct a purely data-driven climate dynamics. In particular,\nsparsity-promoting dynamic mode decomposition is exploited to extract the\ndominant spatial and temporal modes, which are among the most significant\ncoherent structures underlying climate variability, enabling a more efficient,\ninterpretable, and low-dimensional representation of the system dynamics. We\nhope that the combined use of Koopman modes and sparsity-promoting techniques\nwill provide insights into the significant climate modes, enabling\nreduced-order modeling of the climate system and offering a potential framework\nfor predicting and controlling weather and climate variability.",

The plan is to establish a self-sustaining, large scale settlement and democratic, self-governing colony. The motivation behind this is the belief that colonizing Mars will allow humanity to become multiplanetary, thereby ensuring the long-term survival of the human race if it becomes extinct on Earth. Colonization is to be achieved with reusable and mass-produced, super heavy-lift launch vehicles called Starship. They have been referred to as the \"holy grail of rocketry\" for extraplanetary colonization.\nThese plans for colonising Mars have received both praise and criticism. They are supported by public interest in further human involvement beyond Earth and a desire to extend the lifetime of the human race, but doubts have been expressed about whether they will work, how it will be done, and whether humans from Earth could live on Mars.",

Under sustained wind forcing, the wave field then resumes growth. We\nseparately analyze energy transfers during wave growth and breaking-induced\ndissipation. Energy transfers are dominated by pressure input during growth and\nturbulent dissipation during breaking. The wave growth rate scales with\n$(u_\\ast/c)^2$, modulated by the wave steepness due to sheltering. The energy\ndissipation follows the inertial scaling with wave slope at breaking,\nconfirming the universality of the process.

      "content": "Fermi acceleration is believed as a crucial process for the acceleration of\nenergetic electrons within flux ropes (FRs) during magnetic reconnection.\nHowever, in finite-length FRs with a large core field, the finite contracting\nand the escaping of electrons along the axis can significantly limit the\nefficiency of Fermi acceleration. Using observations from the Magnetospheric\nMultiscale mission in the magnetotail, we demonstrate that magnetic mirror\nstructures inside the FR can effectively prevent the escape of energetic\nelectrons and overcome the limitation of finite contraction. Energetic\nelectrons were produced and formed a power-law energy distribution in these\nmirror structures. By evaluating the acceleration rates, we show that these\nenergetic electrons can be continuously accelerated within the mirror\nstructures near the central region of the FR. These results unveil a novel\nmechanism that is universally applicable to electron acceleration within FRs in\nspace, laboratory, and astrophysical plasmas.",

The \"assist\" is provided by the motion of the gravitating body as it pulls on the spacecraft. Any gain or loss of kinetic energy and linear momentum by a passing spacecraft is correspondingly lost or gained by the gravitational body, in accordance with Newton's Third Law. The gravity assist maneuver was first used in 1959 when the Soviet probe Luna 3 photographed the far side of Earth's Moon, and it was used by interplanetary probes from Mariner 10 onward, including the two Voyager probes' notable flybys of Jupiter and Saturn.",

      "content": "The terraforming of Venus is the hypothetical planetary engineering procedure that would transform Venus from a planet hostile to life to one that could sustainably host humans and other lifeforms free of protection or mediation. \nNecessary adjustments to the existing environment of Venus to support human life would require changes including the reduction of the planet's surface temperature of 737 K (464 °C; 867 °F) and the elimination of most of the planet's dense 9.2 MPa (91 atm) carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide atmosphere via removal or conversion to some other form, alongside the addition of breathable oxygen to the atmosphere. These changes are closely interrelated, as Venus's extreme temperature is due to the high pressure of its dense atmosphere and the greenhouse effect.\nProposals to modify the planet include \"veiling\" the planet from the sun, thus dropping the temperature low enough to condense or solidify carbon dioxide, which would then need to be removed or stored in some way.",

The idea that the Sun could explode in this manner has served as the basis for many stories about disaster striking Earth, though it is now recognized that this cannot actually happen. Recurring themes in these stories include anticipating the inevitable destruction while being helpless and evacuating the planet, sometimes with the assistance of helpful aliens. The destruction of Earth in this manner occasionally serves as backstory explaining why humanity has started colonizing the cosmos. Another recurring scenario is radiation from more distant supernovae threatening Earth. Besides humans, alien civilizations are also occasionally subject to the dangers of supernovae. Supernovae are induced intentionally in several works, typically for use as weapons but sometimes for more peaceful purposes, and naturally occurring supernovae are likewise exploited in some stories.",

On March 23, 1900, a bill approved in the New Jersey Legislature created the Borough of Avon-by-the-Sea. On March 13, 1907, the eastern portion of Neptune City was annexed to the Borough of Bradley Beach. The borough was named for Neptune, the Roman water deity, and its location on the Atlantic Ocean.\nThe earliest borough hall was erected in 1902 at the northwest corner of Evergreen Avenue and Railroad Avenue (now Memorial Drive).",

      "content": "This paper investigates the observable properties of a Kerr-Sen black hole\nsurrounded by a thin accretion disk, focusing on the impact of the black hole's\nspin and charge on the image. Using ray-tracing techniques, we conduct a\ndetailed analysis of the black hole's image, redshift distribution, and\nintensity distributions at different observation frequencies. The results\ndemonstrate that spin has a more significant effect on the distortion of the\ninner shadow than charge, and the observer's inclination angle plays a critical\nrole in shaping the redshift distribution, especially near the innermost stable\ncircular orbit. Additionally, the intensity is found to be higher at 86 GHz\nthan at 230 GHz. This study highlights the crucial role of the accretion disk's\ngeometry in determining the black hole's image and redshift effects, thereby\nproviding a refined theoretical framework to guide future observational efforts\ntargeting the Kerr-Sen black hole and its electromagnetic signals.",

Policy guidance can influence the degree to which user needs influence mission design and when, and ensure that satellite missions serve both the scientific and user communities without becoming unfocused and overly expensive. By considering the needs of the user community early on in the mission-design process, agencies can ensure that satellites meet the needs of multiple constituencies.

The equation summarizes the main concepts which scientists must contemplate when considering the question of other radio-communicative life. It is more properly thought of as an approximation than as a serious attempt to determine a precise number.\nCriticism related to the Drake equation focuses not on the equation itself, but on the fact that the estimated values for several of its factors are highly conjectural, the combined multiplicative effect being that the uncertainty associated with any derived value is so large that the equation cannot be used to draw firm conclusions.",

      "content": "K2-18b closely orbits a nearby M3 dwarf within its habitable zone, where this\nplanet could be either a super-Earth or a mini-Neptune. Recent studies using\ntransit spectroscopy suggest that it is Hycean in nature, but this\nclassification is currently controversial. We use the N-body integrator rebound\nand its extension library reboundx to investigate the possibility of exomoons\naround K2-18b. Due to tidal interactions that induce outward migration, we find\nthat any moons would be extremely unlikely. If formed, their lifetimes would be\nrelatively short, not exceeding 10 Myr assuming Earth-like or Neptune-like\ntidal parameters for K2-18b. Recent studies estimate the stellar (and system)\nlifetime as 3 Gyr, which is significantly longer than the tidal migration\ntimescale. We show that exomoons are unlikely to survive around K2-18b due to\nrapid tidal-driven migration, casting doubt on moon-based habitability\nscenarios for short-period M-dwarf planets in general.",

We demonstrate that the nature of the singularity depends\ncrucially on the relative strength C of the velocity and magnetic fields at the\ntime of initialisation: (i) if C < 1, then the swirl components, at the wall,\nevolve towards square profiles that lead to the intensification of shear at the\nmeridional plane (r = 1, z = L/2) and the development of a finite-time\nsingularity; (ii) if C = 1, there is no temporal evolution; (iii) if C > 1,\nthen the swirl components, at the wall, evolve towards a cusp-type singularity.\nBy examining the spatiotemporal evolution of the pressure, we obtain insights\ninto the development of these singularities.",

As all blood vessels allow a degree of protein leak , true equilibrium across the membrane cannot occur and there is a continuous flow of water with small solutes. The molecular sieving properties of the capillary wall reside in a recently discovered endocapillary layer rather than in the dimensions of pores through or between the endothelial cells.

The film debuted at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 8, 2008, and was released theatrically in Canada by Mongrel Media on March 6, 2009.\nJackson plays Ben Tyler, who has been diagnosed with cancer. Requiring immediate treatment, he instead decides to take a motorcycle trip from Toronto across Canada to Vancouver Island. Along the way, he meets several people that help him reevaluate his relationship with his fiancée Samantha (played by Balaban), his job, and his dream of becoming a writer.\nThe scenic backdrop of the Canadian landscape as well as an all-Canadian soundtrack serve as prevalent influences in the film.\nJoshua Jackson won Best Actor at the 2010 Genie Awards for his portrayal of Ben Tyler. Liane Balaban was nominated for Best Supporting Actress.",

The\napproach is successfully validated against the exact solutions up to eight\nneutrinos. In all cases where the exact solution is feasible, the PSA provides\nexcellent reproduction of the neutrino oscillation dynamics. By replacing the\nfull problem with a set of simple mean-field equations, the PSA offers a\nversatile, predictive, and easily parallelizable approach for tackling\nthree-flavor problems. This enables the simulation of large-scale neutrino\noscillations, as illustrated here with simulations involving up to 300\nneutrinos.

If such scalars couple quadratically to particles of the Standard\nModel the scalar acquires an effective mass which depends on the local matter\nenergy density. The changing mass causes the field to deviate from its\ncosmological value in experimental environments. In this work we show that the\npresence of a local over-density enclosing the experiment, for example a\ncavity, vacuum chamber, or satellite can strongly suppress the value of the\nscalar and its gradient in the interior. This makes detection of such scalar\ndark matter challenging, and significantly relaxes constraints on strongly\ncoupled models. We also discuss the possibility that quadratically coupled\nultra-light scalar dark matter could be detected by the differential\nmeasurement of the force on two cavities of the same mass but different\ninternal structure.",

It was released in 2004 through Lobão's now-defunct label and magazine OutraCoisa. The album is notable for its censored track \"Fátima Bernardes Experiência\", which was omitted in order to avoid any controversies regarding Bernardes and Glória Maria, who is also mentioned on the song's lyrics. In 2005, Skylab himself re-issued the album on a very limited run, re-introducing the censored song. In 2023, nineteen years after Skylab V's original release, \"Fátima Bernardes Experiência\" was re-issued as a single.\nThe album (including \"Fátima Bernardes Experiência\") can be downloaded for free on Skylab's official website. A music video for \"Você Vai Continuar Fazendo Música?\" was released on March 18, 2025, and on March 26 the song was also re-issued as a single.",

This is motivated by the fact that the\nfundamental dynamics of such plasmas is poorly understood and plays an\nimportant role in the electrodynamics of extreme astrophysical environments\nsuch as pulsar magnetospheres. The most obvious observable for which such a\nregime has been reached is the production of a bright flash of x-rays, but\ndistinguishing this from other sources of hard x-rays (e.g., bremsstrahlung) is\na major challenge. Here we show that the photons from the X-ray flash are\nhighly polarised, as compared to the unpolarised background, i.e., polarisation\nis an indicator that the SFQED plasma has really produced. For a laser of\nintensity $10^{21}$ Wcm$^{-2}$ impinging on a solid Al target, the photons of\nthe flash with energy $>10$\\thinspace keV are $>65\\%$ polarised.",

This can help a fusion machine designer build intuition about the\neffects of spin-polarization on neutron wall loading.

The notion of reduction strategy is distinct, although some authors conflate the two terms and the definition of each term is not widely agreed upon. A programming language's evaluation strategy is part of its high-level semantics. Some languages, such as PureScript, have variants with different evaluation strategies. Some declarative languages, such as Datalog, support multiple evaluation strategies.\nThe calling convention consists of the low-level platform-specific details of parameter passing.",

If the amplified field is reflected back towards the black hole, the amplification can be repeated, leading to a run-away growth of the field, i.e. an explosion. This explosion can be as powerful as a supernova. One way this reflection could be realized in nature is if the bosonic field has mass. The mass of the field can then cause the amplified modes to be trapped around the black hole, leading to an endless cycle of self-amplification. This is called a superradiant instability, as the amplified field can be generated out of noise, making the system inherently unstable. It can also refer to one such method of creating such a runaway effect, a Penrose sphere with no means for energy to passively escape.",

First, any water formed from oxidation reactions in the magma ocean\nwould quickly outgass because of the water-poor atmosphere above. Second, the\ntop boundary layer of the magma ocean becomes stable against convection because\nthe oxidation reactions produce metallic iron, which sinks to the core of a\ngrowing Earth. This iron loss makes the top boundary layer significantly more\nbuoyant than the rest of the magma, thus becoming stable against mixing.

The way the planet has been depicted has evolved as more has become known about its composition; it was initially portrayed as being entirely solid, later as having a high-pressure atmosphere with a solid surface underneath, and finally as being entirely gaseous. It was a popular setting during the pulp era of science fiction. Life on the planet has variously been depicted as identical to humans, larger versions of humans, and non-human. Non-human life on Jupiter has been portrayed as primitive in some works and more advanced than humans in others.\nThe moons of Jupiter have also been featured in a large number of stories, especially the four Galilean moons—Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto.

      "content": "Grid type pre-initial conditions are commonly used to initialize particle\npositions in cosmological simulations. While these conditions are known to\nproduce noticeable numerical artifacts in void regions, their impact on halo\nproperties has generally been assumed to be negligible. In this work, we employ\nmultiple simulations to demonstrate that grid initialization induces\nstatistically significant artifacts in halo shapes, despite the modest absolute\namplitude ($\\sim 1\\%$) making them unimportant for most cosmological studies.\nWe identify a redshift-dependent artificial alignment pattern: at low redshifts\n($z<2$), halo shapes preferentially orient away from the simulation box's\nCartesian axes, whereas their constituent particles initially exhibit alignment\nwith these axes. We propose a mathematical hypothesis to explain this flipping\nbehavior.",

Encke was first recorded by Pierre Méchain on 17 January 1786, but it was not recognized as a periodic comet until 1819 when its orbit was computed by Johann Franz Encke. Like Halley's Comet, it is unusual in its being named after the calculator of its orbit rather than its discoverer. Like most comets, it has a very low albedo, reflecting only 4.6% of the light its nucleus receives, although comets generate a large coma and tail that can make them much more visible during their perihelion (closest approach to the Sun). The diameter of the nucleus of Encke's Comet is 4.8 km.",

      "content": "Simulated maps of the microwave background (CMB) radiation are generally\ncreated using one of two methods: all-sky simulations use the spherical\nharmonic transform, while maps covering small areas approximate the sky as\nflat, allowing the use of fast Fourier transforms (FFTs). Current and\nnear-future experiments, particularly ones like CMB S4, will cover areas too\nlarge for the flat-sky approximation but significantly less than the full sky.\nIn this regime, it can be more efficient to simulate maps in a 3-D box using\nFFTs, and then sample onto the observed part of the celestial sphere. We\npresent a method for performing such simulations and show that it can be more\nefficient than full-sky simulations. We develop the method for scalar maps, but\nwe expect it to be applicable to higher-spin (e.g., polarization) simulations\nas well.",

Holography is best known as a method of generating three-dimensional images but it also has a wide range of other applications.\nA hologram is made by superimposing a second wavefront (normally called the reference beam) on the wavefront of interest, thereby generating an interference pattern which is recorded on a physical medium.   When only the second wavefront illuminates the interference pattern, it is diffracted to recreate the original wavefront.  Holograms can also be computer-generated by modelling the two wavefronts and adding them together digitally.  The resulting digital image is then printed it onto a suitable mask or film and illuminated by a suitable source to reconstruct the wavefront of interest.",

We show that the electric field is induced\nin the magnetic core of the vortex due to the axion-photon conversion.\nMoreover, because the electromagnetic field is confined in the vortex and\nexcluded from the superconducting bulk regions due to the Meissner effect, the\nvortex tube can be regarded as a cylindrical cavity, and our numerical analysis\nshows that the resonant cavity mode (TM010 mode) can be efficiently enhanced in\nthis tube. We also focus on the interaction of two vortices in the oscillating\naxion background, resulting in attractive or repulsive forces, even in the case\nwith the BPS limit. These new features open up a new possibility for the axion\ndark matter search using superconducting devices.",

Many aircraft carriers and submarines currently use uranium fueled nuclear reactors that can provide propulsion for long periods  without refueling. There are also applications in the space sector with nuclear thermal and nuclear electric engines which could be more efficient than conventional rocket engines. \nThe idea of using nuclear material for propulsion dates back to the beginning of the 20th century. In 1903 it was hypothesized that radioactive material, radium, might be a suitable fuel for engines to propel cars, planes, and boats. H. G.

It is difficult to predict the maximum brightness of new comets with any degree of certainty, but Hale–Bopp exceeded most predictions when it passed perihelion on April 1, 1997, reaching about magnitude −1.8. Its massive nucleus size made it visible to the naked eye for a record 18 months.  This is twice as long as the Great Comet of 1811, the previous record holder. Accordingly, Hale–Bopp was dubbed the Great Comet of 1997.",

Demolition began on the building two days after the quake and completed after a two week period. It was one of two tower buildings that were rendered structurally leaning due to the earthquake, next to other damaged buildings including the National Hualien Girls' Senior High School.",

Under the current system, the space launch company is liable for any damages up to $500 million, after which the U.S. Government will pay the damages in the range of $500 million to $2.7 billion. Above $2.7 billion, the company is again responsible. The Space Launch Liability Indemnification Extension Act was passed by the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress.",

As a white dwarf cools, crystallization of the interior releases  energy, slowing the cooling rate. However, the cooling rates modelled on this crystal formation process do not always match that of observed samples of ultramassive white dwarfs. Instead, sedimentation of more massive ions may provide the missing heat via the release of gravitational energy.
