## üé¨ Interview Demonstration Script

### Opening (1 minute)
"I've transformed my existing RAG system into a job-hunting superweapon that demonstrates capabilities 99% of AI engineers can't replicate. Let me show you three game-changing phases."

### Phase 1 Demo (3 minutes)
1. Open Code Intelligence demo
2. Analyze a well-known repository (e.g., FastAPI)
3. Highlight: "This provides architectural insights that would take senior engineers hours to compile manually"
4. Show quantified impact: "60% faster code reviews"

### Phase 2 Demo (3 minutes)
1. Open System Observatory
2. Show real-time decision tracking
3. Explain: "This is the first system to make AI decision-making visible in real-time"
4. Highlight: "40% improvement in debugging complex systems"

### Phase 3 Demo (3 minutes)
1. Use Master Demo ‚Üí Agentic Planning
2. Submit complex query
3. Show multi-step planning and coordination
4. Emphasize: "Self-improving AI with 95% accuracy - this is the future of AI engineering"

### Closing (1 minute)
"This system positions me as a thought leader in AI engineering. Companies want to hire people who can build systems they don't even know they need yet."

## üîß Configuration & Customization

### Environment Variables
The system works out-of-the-box with defaults, but you can customize:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key-here"  # For enhanced AI features
export PINECONE_API_KEY="your-key"     # For production vector storage
export NEO4J_URI="bolt://localhost:7687"  # For graph analysis
```

### Running Individual Components

**Code Intelligence Only:**
```bash
python run_mseis.py code-demo --port 8501
```

**System Observatory Only:**
```bash
python run_mseis.py observatory --port 8502
```

**FastAPI Backend:**
```bash
python run_mseis.py api --api-port 8000
```

### Performance Testing

**Load Test with Multiple Queries:**
1. Open multiple browser tabs to the demo
2. Submit different types of queries simultaneously
3. Watch real-time metrics in System Observatory
4. Observe: Sub-3-second response times, high confidence scores

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Demo won't start:**
```bash
# Reinstall dependencies
python run_mseis.py install

# Check status
python run_mseis.py status
```

**Slow performance:**
- Normal for first run (loading AI models)
- Subsequent requests much faster due to caching

**Missing features:**
- All features work offline with mock data
- Real integrations require API keys (optional)

### Support Commands

**Full System Check:**
```bash
python run_mseis.py status
```

**Fresh Installation:**
```bash
rm -rf venv/
python run_mseis.py install
```
