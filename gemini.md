# Gemini RAG

This project is a simple Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that uses a local vector database (FAISS) and a web search component to answer questions. The user interface is built with Streamlit.

## Key Features

*   **Hybrid Search:** Combines local vector search with web search to provide comprehensive answers.
*   **Ollama Integration:** Uses a local Ollama instance to generate responses.
*   **Streamlit UI:** A simple and intuitive web interface for interacting with the RAG system.

## To run this application
