## 🏗️ **Step-by-Step System Process Documentation**

### **Master Demo Flow (Most Important)**

#### **Phase 1: Code Intelligence Agent**
```
1. User enters GitHub repository (e.g., "facebook/react")
2. System clones/analyzes repository structure
3. AST parser extracts code patterns and architecture
4. AI agent identifies:
   - Architecture patterns (MVC, microservices, etc.)
   - Technology stack (languages, frameworks, databases)
   - Code quality metrics (complexity, maintainability)
   - Security vulnerabilities
5. Visual diagram generator creates architecture visualization
6. Response includes actionable insights and recommendations
```

**🎯 Interview Impact:** "I built an AI that analyzes code 60% faster than manual reviews"

#### **Phase 2: System Observatory**
```
1. User accesses real-time dashboard
2. System monitors all agent activities across the platform
3. Decision tracker logs every AI decision with:
   - Agent selection reasoning
   - Confidence scores
   - Processing times
   - Success/failure rates
4. Live metrics update every few seconds showing:
   - Active queries in progress
   - Agent performance comparisons  
   - System health indicators
   - Query journey visualizations
5. Interactive exploration of decision pathways
```

**🎯 Interview Impact:** "I created the first real-time AI decision monitoring system"

#### **Phase 3: Agentic Planning**
```
1. User submits complex multi-step query
2. Planning agent decomposes into sub-tasks:
   - Analysis: "What information do I need?"
   - Strategy: "Which agents should handle each part?"
   - Execution: "How do I coordinate the workflow?"
3. Orchestrator coordinates multiple specialized agents:
   - Document Agent: Text processing and retrieval
   - Code Intelligence Agent: Technical analysis
   - Image Agent: Visual content processing
4. Self-reflection mechanism evaluates results:
   - "Did I answer the complete question?"
   - "What could be improved?"
   - "Should I retry with different approach?"
5. Final synthesis combines all agent outputs
```

**🎯 Interview Impact:** "I built self-improving AI that coordinates multiple agents"
